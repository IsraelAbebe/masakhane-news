business	Customers could get £100 for cutting energy use	"One energy supplier is predicting households could earn around £100 over the winter through a scheme to reduce peak-time energy use.
Octopus Energy said it expects to pay on average £4 each time a customer responds to a request to cut back.
National Grid will announce full details of the scheme, which can be adopted by all energy suppliers, later this month.
grid operator said some customers might get as much as £10 a day.
rsuade people to wait until later on to run their washing machine, tumble dryer, or dishwasher, and to not charge their electric car if demand is already high. 
me, set to start next month and run until March 2023, aims to help the UK avoid blackouts, by reducing energy consumption at peak times.
On Thursday National Grid warned homes could face three-hour rolling blackouts, if the UK is unable to secure enough gas and electricity imports, as demand rises over the colder months.
UK relies on gas to generate electricity, but the war in Ukraine has led to pressure on gas supplies across Europe.
Number Ten ruled out running a campaign being worked up by the business ministry to persuade households to consume less electricity.
But the National Grid is set to announce soon exactly how much it will pay per kilowatt hour for people cutting back when there is an acute shortfall in supply.
""Instead of cutting off whole chunks of the country if we are short of gas, we can reward people for using less energy at times of peak demand,"" Octopus chief executive Greg Jackson said.
k service will be available to homes that have smart meters installed, as long as their supplier is taking part in the scheme. There are about 14 million households with electricity smart meters in the UK.
Octopus Energy, which ran a trial of the scheme earlier this year, said there could be 25 days over the next six months when National Grid was willing to pay households to reduce their use.
Julie Byrne in Saffron Walden embraced the Octopus trial with gusto. She switched off lights, hung the towels outdoors to dry, turned the computer off, and even postponed dinner, despite her 25-year-old son rolling his eyes.
""Sometimes it was inconvenient,"" she says. ""But we worked round it.""
Her smart meter is outdoors so Julie didn't check which of her cut-backs was saving more, but she did see a small reduction in her next bill.
""It wasn't just the money. I felt I was helping,"" she said, though with the cost of living rising, she thinks, the payments are ""always going to be a plus.""
Customers who managed to cut back compared to their recent average electricity consumption would be rewarded with a payment, likely to be between £3 and £6 per kilowatt hour saved, Octopus said. 
mpensation rate was likely to be set higher on days when the energy shortfall was particularly severe, the firm said.
During Octopus' trial in February and March customers saved an average of 0.7 kilowatt hours, but were receiving much lower financial compensation, the firm said.
Under the National Grid-backed scheme, customers, including businesses, will receive an email or text a day ahead, outlining the time slot when they would be paid if they reduce their energy use, usually between 4pm and 7pm.
Mr Jackson believes the financial incentive, which is significantly higher than it was in the trial, will prove effective, noting that people regularly change their habits to make savings - even small ones.
""If you go to the supermarket and you buy stuff that's reduced to clear, you're saving less than a pound. People respond to that,"" said Mr Jackson. 
He believes there will be savings for the country as a whole as well. ""Today our system pays a fortune to have diesel and coal generation on standby.
""Every unit of energy that is saved will save on expensive standby diesel and coal.""

business	Energy bills: 'We cut back but are paying three times as much'	"Amy Appleyard had been paying £136 a month to heat and light her home.
Knowing that energy bills would rise in the autumn, she and her family had cut back on how much power they were using.
But they were shocked to be told that their monthly direct debit would rise more than three times to £442.
re just one of many UK households who have cut back on energy but are still being charged higher direct debits. But suppliers say bills have to reflect soaring energy prices.
It comes after Business Secretary Grant Shapps wrote to energy firms asking them to ensure bills reflected the amount of energy customers were using, and not to over-estimate charges. 
Mrs Appleyard, her husband Mike and eight-year-old daughter Kathryn, faced the huge hike in direct debit energy payments despite cutting back at their three-bedroom home in Greater Manchester.
""We've all become a bit more obsessive about turning off lights or unplugging chargers,"" Mrs Appleyard said.
""We also didn't put the heating on as early as usual this year, just maybe for an hour to warm the house through.""
She said her family's ""nightmare"" started because her supplier cut their monthly direct debit without telling them, so when it made its annual review of their monthly payments it led to a much bigger increase than usual.
""After spending hours on the phone, and being guaranteed that I would pay £200 monthly, and then seeing that £442 was still taking out of my account, I just burst into tears,"" she said.
Since then there have been more conversations and Mrs Appleyard said she hoped the situation will soon be sorted.
""We just want to pay for the gas and electricity we used but it's become very difficult,"" she said.
""I've been told that only £200 will be taken out of my account in December, but the situation is ongoing and has been horribly stressful.""
Meanwhile, Rory in South Wales said his direct debits had also gone up, while his energy use had gone down, so he ended up £1,400 in credit with his supplier.
He told Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show that he had asked to reduce his direct debit to a monthly amount he could afford but his supplier refused.
He said the direct debits have been increased to £481 even though his monthly usage has been nearer £300.
""I simply want to reduce it to an amount I can afford to pay and use the surplus to top up. I don't want to have all that money sitting there and me paying a ridiculous amount to the energy provider,"" he said.
Customers who pay gas and electricity bills by direct debit have the costs evened out over the year in a process known as smoothing.
m of smoothing is to avoid sudden bill shocks by spreading the cost over the whole year so even if you use a lot more energy in a winter month, you don't get a nasty surprise.
u get should be the actual amount you're charged for your energy. It is a combination of a standing daily charge plus your metered energy usage (your unit rate per kWh). 
It will change every month, depending on how much energy you use.
Suppliers encourage direct debit payments by offering customers a discount. They then estimate what your bills will be over the year, based on the price of gas and electricity and on your previous and predicted energy use.
Suppliers should ensure your direct debit payment is fair and proportionate to your usage.
If any customer ends up overpaying, they should be able to claim the extra amount back at the end of the year and maybe reduce their direct debits.
However rising energy costs - prices have doubled since last year - have left most people facing higher direct debits.
If your direct debit payments are regularly higher than your bills, you can challenge the amount with your supplier. 
Ask them to lower your monthly payments to reflect more accurately the amount of energy you actually use, based on your meter readings.
If they refuse you can make a complaint to your supplier and if you get no satisfaction you can escalate it to the Energy Ombudsman. 
Earlier this year, an Ofgem review of how energy firms were charging customers by direct debit revealed that about 500,000 households had seen their payments double, despite prices rising by 54%.
It told UK energy suppliers to review the way they charge customers by direct debit.
Ofgem said it had already called on firms to address the issue, but would be prepared to take further action if necessary.
At the weekend Mr Shapps told energy firms: ""I am interested to understand how you intend to ensure that your direct debit system does not over-estimate charging.""
Energy UK, the industry trade body, has said rising direct debits were inevitable as bills had to reflect the doubling in energy prices since last year.
Household energy costs are set to rise again next year which will mean further rises in direct debits.
government's energy price guarantee is being scaled back from April, when a typical household's annual bill will increase to £3,000."
business	Crown Resorts: Casino firm fined over illegal China dealings	"Australian gaming operator Crown Resorts has been fined A$80m ($57.4m; £45.6m) for illegally accepting Chinese bank cards at its casino in Melbourne.
Regulators say the transactions were falsely classified as hotel services.
r money laundering and excessive gambling casinos in Australia are not allowed to accept bank cards.
Crown acknowledged its ""historic failings"" and says its top executives were in the process of reforming how the company operates.
On Monday, the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission (VGCCC) said Crown had breached Australia's casino regulations by allowing gambling funds to be withdrawn using credit or debit cards.
regulator found that Crown had processed A$164m Australian dollars in China UnionPay card payments, drawing in A$32m of revenue in the process, between 2012 and 2016.
It said the transactions were falsely classified as ""services"" provided by the Crown Towers hotel in Melbourne.
However, patrons were given vouchers that could be exchanged for cash or chips at Crown's neighbouring casino.
According to the regulator, the ""clandestine"" scheme also allowed some Chinese nationals to spend more in foreign currencies than was allowed under Chinese law.
""Crown benefited handsomely from its illegal conduct,"" VGCCC chairwoman Fran Thorn said in a statement.
""The fine will ensure that Crown is stripped of the revenue it derived from the process and will send a clear message that it must comply with its regulatory obligations,"" Ms Thorn added.
In response, the gaming group said its board and senior management were ""committed to the delivery of a comprehensive reform and remediation programme to ensure Crown delivers a safe and responsible gaming environment"".
Crown - which operates integrated resorts in Melbourne, Perth and Sydney - is also under scrutiny from regulators who have alleged the company had knowingly dealt with criminal organisations then misled authorities about those dealings.
Its casino in Melbourne is currently only allowed to operate under the supervision of a government-appointed manager.

business	Energy bills: More help may be expected next year, says think tank	"government is likely to come under pressure to help households with soaring energy bills again next year, the Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank has warned.
IFS said calls for help were likely to continue for ""at least"" another year if oil and gas prices do not fall.
Energy bills are expected to keep rising until at least spring 2023.
But the government insisted the support package announced by the chancellor on Thursday was a ""temporary"" measure.
£15bn package means every UK household will get an energy bill discount of £400 from October, with further support for the poorest households, pensioners and disabled people.
w measures add to around £17bn of support already given by the government. This included one-off £150 council tax rebates for most homes in England and Wales and matched funding for the other devolved nations.
A steep rise in the cost of living, in particular a jump in energy prices in April, and a second one scheduled for October, had put growing pressure on the government to take action.
uncement, which came a day after the publication of Sue Gray's report into rule-breaking at Downing Street during the pandemic, was on a larger scale than many expected.
upport was broadly welcomed and described as a ""genuinely big package"" by the IFS. 
However, the think tank warned that it could prompt calls for additional support again next year, which in turn could contribute to further inflation.
""I think the biggest risk is that the chancellor will be tempted to do this again and again, and I think if that happens then we really could be in for a bit of trouble,"" IFS director Paul Johnson told the BBC's Today programme.
""He's got the most extraordinarily difficult decisions to make later this year on public sector pay, and then he'll be under pressure I suspect again this time next year when energy prices will still be high. 
""I think if he's tempted to continue putting money in to an economy where inflation is very high then that becomes a significant risk.""
Adam Scorer, chief executive of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, said the chancellor's measures averted ""the darkest of outcomes"" but warned ""millions will still be struggling and the energy crisis is far from over"".
He said a ""large, more targeted intervention is what was needed ahead of winter"", and said the government needed to plan for energy prices to remain high for some time. 
f living is set to continue to rise, with inflation - the rate at which prices go up - at a 40-year high and forecast to hit 10% later this year. 
Concerns have also been raised that the extra support for households could contribute to further inflation, by providing more spending power in the economy at a time when supply chains and the labour market are struggling to meet demand.
However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak insisted that his new measures would have a ""minimal impact"" on inflation.
Higher energy prices, caused in part by the war in Ukraine, have been a key factor driving inflation and analysts expect energy costs to remain high.
Cornwall Insight, has predicted the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, will be marginally higher in spring 2023 to around £2,818 than the price cap this autumn at £2,791. 
f the extra support for energy bills will be partly offset by a 25% additional tax on oil and gas firms' profits, which have soared in recent months.
Opposition parties had been calling for a windfall tax on energy firms for several months. 
A windfall tax is a one-off levy imposed by a government on a company. The idea is to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall.
Mr Sunak said the ""energy profits levy"" had been designed so it would ""incentivise and encourage investment"".
But Dan Atzori, research partner at Cornwall Insight, warned the tax came with ""risks to both investment and energy security"".
If windfall taxes were repeated over time, Mr Atzori said, it risked ""creating an unstable environment, and may lead to energy producers, who operate globally, investing and relocating to other areas"".
government had previously rejected the idea of a windfall tax on energy firms' profit, but Mr Sunak said with the sector ""making extraordinary profits"" he was ""sympathetic to the argument to tax those profits fairly"".
However, energy giant BP said while it knew ""how difficult things are for people"" Thursday's announcement was ""not for a one-off tax"" but a ""multi-year proposal"".
""Naturally we will now need to look at the impact of both the new levy and the tax relief on our North Sea investment plans,"" it said.
which represents oil and gas firms, Offshore Energies UK, said the levy would ""drive away"" investors and cut UK energy production."
business	UK faces worst downturn of any advanced economy, OECD says	"UK economy will suffer a bigger blow from the global energy crisis than other leading nations, according to international body the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
UK will contract by more than any other nation in the G7 group next year, it said.
Growth in the US and the eurozone will be weak, but Germany is the only other major economy expected to shrink.
OECD forecasts a ""significant growth slowdown"" globally in 2023.
ks to the strength of emerging economies, the world economy will grow by 2.2% next year, the OECD's latest report predicts.
But the war in Ukraine was affecting economies unevenly, the OECD said, with European countries bearing the brunt of the impact on business, trade and the spike in energy prices. 
G7 includes the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. While growth is expected to be weaker in most countries in the group, only Germany and the UK will contract, the OECD predicts.
OECD expects the UK's economyto shrink by 0.4% in 2023 to be followed by shallow growth of just 0.2% in 2024.
By contrast, last week the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted the UK would shrink by 1.4% next year, although it also predicted stronger growth, of 1.3% in 2024. The OBR said that would lead to the biggest drop in living standards on record.
Earlier this month the Bank of England predicted the downturn could last for two years.
Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to fall by 0.3%, the OECD report says.
Of the wider group of G20 countries, only Russia, which is subject to economic sanctions, is predicted to fare worse than the UK.
OECD, an intergovernmental body that focuses on economic policy, lays some of the blame for the UK's poor performance on the Energy Price Guarantee, the scheme to support household and business energy bills.
While subsidising energy bills reduces the immediate headline inflation rate, the OECD warns that it will add to overall demand in the economy, increasing inflationary pressures in the medium-term. That in turn would require the Bank of England to raise interest rates further and add to the cost of servicing debts.
""Better targeting of measures to cushion the impact of high energy prices would lower the budgetary cost, better-preserve incentives to save energy, and reduce the pressure on demand at a time of high inflation,"" it said.
UK government is moving away from universal support for energy bills after this winter, the prime minister's spokesman pointed out. 
""We're taking a different approach post-April to the energy support, targeting it towards the most vulnerable,"" he said.
In response to the OECD's forecast for the economy, he said this year the UK was forecast to be the fastest growing economy in the G7.
""These are challenges that are affecting different countries at slightly different times,"" he said. 
""We emerged from the pandemic faster than many other countries in Europe. But some of these challenges are shared,"" he said. 
Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said: ""We are forecast to be the only OECD economy that will be smaller in 2024 than it was in 2019.
""This is the Tory doom loop. A low growth spiral leading to higher taxes, lower investment, squeezed wages and poor public services.""
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney described the OECD forecast as a ""damning verdict"" and said a succession of Conservative chancellors this year had wrecked hope of growth.
OECD said UK inflation - which hit a 41-year high of 11.1% in October - is likely to peak at the end of this year but remain above 9% in early 2023, slowing to 4.5% by the end of next year.
rganisation expects UK interest rates to rise from their current level of 3% to 4.5% next April and unemployment to rise to 5% by the end of 2024. 
f paying for help with energy bills showed up on the government's accounts in October, as households began receiving the first tranche of a £400 subsidy, and the lower £2,500 energy price cap came into effect.
Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that these schemes together cost £3.4bn in October.
ushed up government borrowing - the difference between government spending and tax income - to £13.5bn last month, the ONS said.
Although the figure was £4.4bn higher than last year it was lower than analysts had expected.
ONS said that borrowing in the financial year to date - covering April to October 2022 - was £84.4bn, although this was £21.7bn less than in the same period last year."
entertainment	English National Opera fights 'absurd' plan to relocate to Manchester	"English National Opera's boss has dismissed a plan to move out of London and slash its funding as ""not doable"".
On Friday, Arts Council England said it would axe the company's entire £12.6m annual grant from 2023, instead giving it £17m over three years - but only if it relocates, possibly to Manchester.
On Wednesday, the ENO's Stuart Murphy said: ""I think we're going to be saying to the secretary of state tomorrow and to the Arts Council, 'We can definitely do levelling up, but that can only happen with a big London base.'""
He described the Arts Council's plan - which he only learned about a day before the announcement - as ""absurd"" and ""insane"".
restigious company is now campaigning for the decision to be reversed, and is supporting a petition set up by opera singer Sir Bryn Terfel, which has more than 16,000 signatures.
Mr Murphy said he initially thought a move could be viable. ""We then looked at the money over the weekend,"" he told BBC News.
""We spoke to people that the Arts Council hadn't bothered to speak to in Manchester, from across the opera world, and our staff - and it's just not doable.""
One reason is because opera employs people with specialist skills, both on stage and behind the scenes, he said.
""These are skills that can't just be learned in the three years we've been given. These are people who've been in the company for 40 years. It takes a long time to train to be an opera singer. We can't just close down in one area and start in another.""
Also, opera ""requires fundraising on a pretty big scale"", and Manchester has fewer sources of money - some of which have already been tapped by Opera North, which currently tours to Salford.
""So straight away you've got a situation which is really hard, to pull up the really deep roots of an opera company and just transport it,"" Mr Murphy said.
He claimed the Arts Council had not sounded out Leeds-based Opera North, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, or the new home he said ACE had earmarked for the ENO - Manchester's £210m new arts venue, Factory International.
""This came as a complete surprise to them. It came as a massive surprise to us because our report card from the Arts Council says we're doing an amazing job,"" Mr Murphy said.
""It reminds us that one in seven of our audience are under 35, that a fifth of our singers are ethnically diverse, that our average ticket price is a quarter of that of a normal opera house and we give free tickets to under-21s.
""And we do these amazing things like ENO Breathe with the NHS that happen right across the country. So we've kind of done everything that was asked of us and more, even by the Arts Council's admission.
""So to just put in place a funding suggestion, which is half our funding level, 200 miles away, to happen in 20 weeks, is absurd.""
Mr Murphy, who recently announced his departure as ENO chief executive, called on the Arts Council to carry out a strategic review of opera provision across the country.
He warned: ""If they're not careful, they're going to dismantle an arts organisation that's been in existence for almost 100 years and is seen as a beacon for progressive work that's broken down preconceptions of opera.""
ENO is based at the London Coliseum in the West End and is one of two major opera companies in the capital, along with the Royal Opera.
grant delivered by the Arts Council, using government money, accounts for around a third of its annual income.
mpany took the headlines in a wider redistribution of arts funding after the Arts Council was told by the government to move millions of pounds outside the capital.
Arts Council has said the ENO will not receive any funding after April 2023 if it does not relocate.
A spokesperson said: ""We require English National Opera to relocate the core of their work to another part of England if they wish to continue to receive regular public funding from us.
""We raised Manchester as an option and English National Opera initially received that idea positively. English National Opera's future is in their hands - at this early stage we have announced our funding plans for the next three years, and now we hope to engage in detailed planning with them.
""This would involve English National Opera reshaping their business model and finding a suitable location outside of London.""
ENO's bosses could face the decision of whether to move out of London and keep some public funding, or stay in the capital as a privately-funded operation.
""There definitely could be a private opera house in London. There's lots in the south-east already,"" said Mr Murphy, adding that the ticket prices would inevitably increase.
""Straight away you're talking £300-350 for your most expensive ticket. That is not what brings on new work, brings on talent, brings on the next generation.
""It over-caters to the same rich metropolitan middle class audience, and that's why opera is dying as an artform.""
Manchester's Factory International said it had not been contacted by the ENO, and that the Arts Council had not suggested the ENO would move into its new building. 
A spokeswoman said: ""We would of course be enthusiastic to collaborate with ENO on appropriate projects that fitted both organisations' goals - which in our case would be on new works, not the traditional opera repertoire."""
entertainment	Morecambe and Wise 'Monty Python' UEA interview sparks further find	"Morecambe and Wise call Monty Python 'boring' in a TV interview clip unearthed in 2021
A long-lost Morecambe and Wise interview has been found almost in its entirety after a clip hit the headlines last year - prompting the rediscovery.
medy double act told how they were ""bored stiff"" by Monty Python in an old university TV station interview, in a two-minute clip unearthed in 2021.
A restoration expert spotted the story and remembered having the tape, leading to the longer interview being found.
Film professor Melanie Williams said it was ""so important to preserve"" it.
gendary duo were filmed speaking to the University of East Anglia's (UEA) student TV station Nexus after a performance at Norwich's Theatre Royal in November 1973. 
r bruising take on cult comics Monty Python was revealed, with Eric Morecambe saying the ensemble performed ""university comedy... and I'm afraid that a lot of it is very unprofessional"".
However, this latest find featured most of the seven-minute interview, with just the opening seconds missing. 
Morecambe and Wise appeared in a playful mood, but revealed how they felt ""modern"" performers had it too easy reaching the top.
""I think they've reasonably got it made today,"" said Wise. 
""A lot of people are stars and they shouldn't really be stars. They've been accelerated into it.""
""To start is probably more difficult, but once you're on the way it's easier,"" said Morecambe. 
""There's more money to be earned now. You work clubs nowadays with salaries that the tops of the bills used to be getting when we were youngsters.""
Monty Python clip was discovered last year by former station member Paul Hayes, now a BBC radio producer, when he digitised a duplicate copy he had made from an original VHS compilation tape kept in Nexus' studio.
""When I was a student at the UEA in the early 2000s there was a cupboard full of these old Sony reel-to-reel videotapes from the 1970s in the studio,"" he said. 
""One of them was labelled as having a 'famous Nexus in-depth interview' with Morecambe and Wise on it, but we didn't have anything to play it on.""
In 2004, Mr Hayes sent the tape to the BBC but it was unable to be viewed, so they passed it on to restoration specialist Peter Crocker, who was also unable to salvage any material. 
""Peter hung on to the tape all these years and got in touch with me when the story about their Monty Python criticisms made the news, as it had reminded him that he still had it,"" said Mr Hayes.
Mr Crocker then gave the tape to another specialist David Palfreyman, who runs a specialist film and videotape restoration business, and he managed to play the old format after - bizarrely - baking the tape in his oven.
""After a while tapes tend to get sticky,"" said Mr Palfreyman. 
""Once they get sticky, they start to lose their magnetic strip, and if you start to play it chances are the magnetic strip of the tape is just going to fall off. 
""But if you bake it for a certain length of time it kind of resets everything and dries it out.""
However, the other challenge is trying to find the right machine - which is rarely available second-hand and then it often needs refurbishing before it will work to play obsolete formats. 
Interestingly, the full tape - that ran for almost 40 minutes - also contained an interview with famous French mime artist Marcel Marceau, who appeared at the Norfolk and Norwich Festival in October 1973 but without any of his props after they got lost in transit.
Prof Williams, a lecturer in film and television studies at the UEA, said it was important to preserve such rare material.
""There's stuff that you get from it that you don't see in other kinds of interviews,"" she said.
""It's the perfect justification for why it's important to preserve this kind of material. 
""It is rough around the edges in certain ways, but it enables them to do things that other kinds of media can't do, and I think it's so important to preserve those different perspectives that this kind of media can provide.""
Colin Webb, who was then a 25-year-old mature student at the UEA, carried out the interview and was happy it was now available to view again after nearly half a century.
""It just reminds you what delightful people they were, really,"" he said.
""Totally human and funny and relaxed, and surprisingly very willing to give their time to our university TV.""
Speaking last year, Monty Python member Sir Michael Palin said he was ""a little hurt"", but ""intrigued"" having seen the footage.

entertainment	H&M: Justin Bieber collection axed after singer's 'trash' criticism	"H&M has removed a Justin Bieber-inspired collection after it was branded ""trash"" by the singer.
28-year-old said he had not approved the collection, which included T-shirts, jumpers, tote bags and phone accessories.
Posting on his Instagram Story, the Sorry singer urged people not to buy the items which he said were being sold without his permission or approval.
mpany said proper procedures were followed but have now pulled the line.
""The H&M Merch they made out of me is trash and I didn't approve it,"" Justin wrote on his Instagram story on Tuesday. ""Don't buy it. 
""I didn't approve any of the merch collection that they put up at H&M,"" he continued. 
""All without my permission and approval. I wouldn't buy it if I were you.""
In a statement, H&M defended the fashion line, which reportedly features images of the star.
""As with all other licensed products and partnerships, H&M followed proper approval procedures,"" a spokesperson for the fashion retailer said.
""But out of respect for the collaboration and Justin Bieber we have removed the garments from our stores and online.""
It's not the first time a star has hit out at a brand for using their image without permission.
In 2015, Rihanna won a court case against Topshop - she successfully sued its parent company for £3.3m after it sold a sleeveless T-shirt with her photo on it. 
And in 2019, Ariana Grande brought action against Forever 21 after she claimed it published at least 30 ""unauthorised"" images and videos that suggested she had endorsed the brand.
Justin is currently on a break from touring after he revealed he was suffering from facial paralysis, after a diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome.
Ramsay Hunt syndrome is when a shingles outbreak affects the facial nerve near someone's ears, resulting in paralysis of parts of the face.

entertainment	Hugh Jackman: Wolverine star on mental health problems	"Actor Hugh Jackman has said he was ""a hot mess"" making his latest film, The Son.
54-year-old X-Men star explained: ""I certainly realised how vulnerable I was.""
He plays a successful lawyer with a teenage son (Zen McGrath) from a previous marriage who is suffering from depression. 
Jackman told the BBC the subject matter of the film and returning to acting after not working during Covid lockdowns caused him ""anxiety"". 
And then his father died while he was making the movie.
""My father actually never missed a day of work in his life,"" Jackman says, explaining why he did not take any time off to grieve. ""I did imagine what my father would say and he would say, 'Go to work'."" 
Nonetheless, making The Son was hard and the pressure took its toll.
""I would be one of the least [likely] people I know who I'd describe as a hot mess, but I certainly was during this.""
Jackman suffered sleepless nights while playing the role of Peter, a workaholic with a new partner, young baby, an ex-wife and their troubled teenage son. The star says he continues to consult a therapist who helped him through filming. 
film's producers also employed psychiatrists on set in case members of the cast and crew needed to talk about the upsetting material. 
""This was the first time I'd ever seen such a thing on a film,"" says Jackman, ""and people used it and it was necessary.""
While intimacy coaches have become commonplace when sex scenes are being filmed, Jackman advocates mental health support as well. 
""There's a little part of the old school part of my brain [that thinks], 'Well, that's up to you to work out.' If you need to go to a doctor, for whatever reason, your foot, your mental health, you know, you work that out.
""But I think it certainly would be a sign from an employer that we understand taking care of the whole person, not just paying them, but taking care of their wellbeing in all forms is really, really important."" 
See-Saw films, which produced The Son, worked with the Film and TV Charity, which has developed a free industry-wide resource to destigmatise poor mental health in film and TV.
rity's 2021 Looking Glass survey found that nine in 10 people working in the sector had experienced a mental health problem.
Whole Picture Toolkit offers guidance and advice on supporting mental health and wellbeing on set and pre and post-production and, so far, the kit has been adopted by 35 productions. 
Jackman says he hopes The Son will spark conversations around mental health issues ""that are urgently needed"".  
He says: ""There is a real lack of knowledge and ignorance and shame around the subject and I think it's something we need to confront, really, really quickly.""
film, which explores absentee parenting and the effects of divorce on children as well as adolescent mental illness, is tough to watch. 
While The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw praised the ""beautifully composed and literate drama"", not everyone was a fan of The Son, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival and opens in the UK in February. 
Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney said it was ""a depressing film about depression, while The Times' Kevin Maher dismissed it as ""a wearily predicable slab of family values hokum.""
However, Jackman has already received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor for his role in the drama.
It comes at a moment when some are questioning the future of gendered acting categories in awards ceremonies.
Jackman says he's a ""a big fan"" of having one gender neutral acting category in which all performers compete. 
""That would be a really positive step. I don't understand why it's split into just two genders when we all know it's a much bigger spectrum.""
Acknowledging that he ""might have just shot myself in the foot"" as his own chances of winning would be halved if there was one non-binary acting category instead of separate best actor and actress categories, he adds: ""Whatever the mix is, we should maybe just break down any of those categories that end up being divisive and unnecessary."" 
If the past is anything to go by, Jackman could be in with a shout of taking home an award this season. The Son was co-written and directed by Florian Zeller, who directed the 2020 drama The Father, which earned its star Sir Anthony Hopkins his second Oscar. 
Sir Anthony, famous for his roles in The Silence of the Lambs, the Thor movies and Westworld, makes a cameo appearance in The Son.
And Jackman gives a fascinating insight into how Sir Anthony continues to work after more than six decades on screen. 
""He shot for one day. He spent six months emailing the director Florian every single day. Florian said to me, 'I got as many emails about this one scene in a movie as I did for The Father, where he is in every scene.' He takes it so seriously.""
And that meticulous approach continued on set. 
""At one point, he wanted to redo his close-up again. And I pulled Florian aside and I said: 'But what he did was so incredible.' 
""And he said: 'Oh yeah, I've got everything I need, but I think he just misses acting. He hadn't acted for 18 months. I think he just misses it, he wanted another go.'"" 
Son represents a departure for Jackman, who played Wolverine in nine blockbuster films - and is coming back for at least one more. 
He also made his name in movie musicals, including Les Misérables and The Greatest Showman and on Broadway, where he is currently starring in The Music Man. So how does he pick roles?
""I'm always looking for things that I haven't done before, that challenge me, that scare me,"" Jackman says.
""And by the way, when I did Wolverine, it always scared me, too. That's a million miles away from who I am as well."" "
entertainment	Neath: The rock choir bringing women together	"A choir started in 2016 by a woman after her son's second open-heart surgery has become an ensemble of 200 women.
Valley Rock Voices in Neath is a choir of women aged between 21 and 80.
Founder Cerys Llewellyn-Bevan has created a community for women from all backgrounds and all ages, including mothers to grandmothers.
""We are a huge melting pot of every kind of woman,"" said Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan.
Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan started the choir with 12 friends as what she described as an ""antidote"" to her son Sam's second major operation. 
Now 26, Sam has recovered well.
From the choir, a collective has formed with activities such as walking, swimming, social and fund-raising groups.
""When you become a mum your life becomes all about your children growing up, and I think a lot of women lose the ability to go out and make friends,"" said Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan.
""I needed to get out and find some joy again, and going back to my music-making seemed to be the obvious path as it had brought me much joy previously.""
53-year-old has a classical music background and had stints as head of music at various schools.
r's repertoire includes the Bee Gees, The Killers, Katy Perry, Primal Scream and Stormzy. 
re due to perform at Swansea Arena in March with Max Boyce and tenor Wynne Evans.
Day-long ""boot camps"" are held on top of regular rehearsals at Neath Town Hall and St Peter's Church in Newton, Bridgend county. 
r fell silent when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in March 2020. 
""For nine months we didn't meet,"" said Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan. 
""I honestly thought I would never put the choir back together again.
""In November 2020, restrictions started to be eased slightly so I decided to venture out and see if I had anyone who fancied a challenge.""
When restrictions allowed, the choir rehearsed outdoors at Neath RFC, in the rugby stands, socially distanced and groups of 15 at a time.
Bethan Comerford, from Neath, knew Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan from school and found out about the choir on Facebook.
""Up from the sofa I got - my husband said, 'what are you doing?' I said, 'I'm going to join a choir',"" said Ms Comerford.
""It was just what I needed. It's the best thing I have ever done.""
But Ms Comerford's husband died shortly after she joined. 
""It was the middle of Covid, and every night there would be food parcels delivered by people here,"" said the 54-year-old. 
""They were fantastic, and they still are. They're such a great bunch of women.""
Joining the choir has also been of major benefit for its youngest member, Imogen Fish, from Neath. 
Now 21, Ms Fish has done GCSEs, A levels and completed a university degree while with Valley Rock Voices. She is now training to become a teacher.
""When I first started I was so shy,"" she said. 
""I wouldn't speak to anybody or look at anybody. I was going through a tricky time at school. Now I'm a totally different person.""
Joan Powell - the choir's oldest member at 80 - joined on its first day.
""When you get older you don't make lifelong friends so easily, but I have,"" she said. 
""I have formed some beautiful friendships. Everybody takes care of each other. We watch each other's backs."""
health	Glan Clwyd: Serious failings led to death of man - inquest	"A man died from bronchial pneumonia in hospital after information regarding his care was not transferred correctly, a coroner's court has heard.
A hearing into the death of David Schofield Diamond found ""serious failings"" at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire.
79-year-old was admitted with pneumonia and sepsis two weeks before his death in November 2021.
Betsi Cadwaladr health board told the inquest plans to improve had been made.
Mr Diamond, from Prestatyn, had also tested positive for Covid-19 and was having difficulties eating and drinking. 
He was initially placed in the high dependency area of the Covid ward and his breathing was assisted, the hearing was told.
He was also assessed by the speech and language team, who recommended a soft diet of mildly thickened fluids. 
After about 10 days, his condition began to improve and healthcare staff discussed a discharge plan with him and his daughter. 
But when he was moved into another area on the same ward, the information regarding his fluids and diet was not transferred with him to the whiteboard above his new bed. 
ree days before his death, a physiotherapist noticed unthickened drinks on his bedside table, some of which had been consumed. 
On 11 November, Mr Diamond's condition deteriorated to a point where an assessment should have been made by the on-call doctor, with two-hourly observations then taken, and the nurse-in-charge informed. 
However, no observations were made for seven hours and the nurse-in-charge was not told. 
His condition continued to deteriorate and he became unresponsive. A chest X-ray showed there had been aspiration, and he was placed on intravenous antibiotics, but Mr Diamond died on 13 November. 
In a statement read to the coroner's court in Ruthin, the bank nurse looking after Mr Diamond overnight, Gwenda Long, said she had assumed the healthcare support team would do Mr Diamond's two-hourly observations. 
She said she did not escalate his condition to the nurse-in-charge or the assessment team because she had ""misread the term ward-based care"" in his notes, and thought medical escalation was not necessary. 
Giving a narrative conclusion, David Lewis, assistant coroner for north Wales, east and central, said the case showed a ""lack of recognition of deteriorating patient"" with ""human and communication errors"" involved. 
Mr Lewis said that though Mr Diamond had died from pneumonia, a natural cause, the aspiration that played a part was not natural, and it was ""likely"" he aspirated due to consumption of unthickened fluid in the hospital, in spite of recommendations. 
Mr Lewis added that though he could not be satisfied that it would have made a difference to Mr Diamond had a doctor been called at an earlier stage when his condition deteriorated, there had been ""serious failings"" in his care.  
Jane Woollard, associate director of nursing for the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board told the inquest that an improvement plan had been put in place following an investigation into Mr Diamond's death, which included the introduction of colour-coded information sheets on dietary requirements which move around the hospital with patients and a plan to train all nurses to carry out swallow assessments. 
Mr Diamond's daughter, Jody Diamond said she felt let down and was ""heartbroken"" by the loss of her father. "
health	Diphtheria: Migrants with symptoms to be isolated	"Migrants with symptoms of diphtheria are to be put into isolation, as cases of the disease rise, ministers say.
wing signs of infection will be separated for a ""short period"" at the Manston processing centre in Kent, or at a ""designated isolation centre"" while they are treated.
follows the death of a man at Manston, which may have been caused by diphtheria. 
Health secretary Steve Barclay said the risk to the public was ""very low"". 
During a visit to the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, Mr Barclay said a ""very high uptake"" of diphtheria vaccinations within the British public meant many people were well protected. 
He stressed that the situation was being monitored ""closely"".
Diphtheria is a highly contagious infection that affects the nose, throat and sometimes cause ulcers on the skin.
According to the NHS website, it is spread by coughs and sneezes or through close contact with someone who is infected, and in serious cases can be fatal.
It can also be spread by sharing items such as cups, cutlery, clothing or bedding with an infected person. 
UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said there had been an ""increase"" in cases of diphtheria reported among migrants arriving in the UK.
It has confirmed 50 cases were identified as of 25 November, including among children. The figure stood at 39 on November 10.
Public health experts have raised concerns about the spread of the disease as migrants were moved to hotels.
UKHSA report said 38 of the cases have been reported in south-east England, with some cases also detected across London, the West Midlands and the north-east of England.
re offered to people on arrival at their new accommodation.
Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said any asylum seekers who may have the infection but are already in hotels will be told to isolate in their rooms while they are treated. 
He later confirmed the isolation centres would be similar to those used to curb infections during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Mr Jenrick told the Commons: ""From today, no-one presenting with symptoms will progress into the asylum accommodation system.
""They will either remain at Manston, isolating for a short period, or they will travel to a designated isolation centre in secure transport where they will be treated until deemed medically fit.""
reatment of migrants at the processing centre in Kent has triggered a wave of campaigns and concern from health professionals and campaigners. 
At one point, the facility designed to hold 1,600 people contained 4,000. 
Charity Detention Action launched a legal campaign to remove migrants housed in the facility for longer than 24 hours.  
Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the overcrowding was caused by a lack of suitable accommodation.
She told MPs: ""What I have refused to do is to prematurely release thousands of people into local communities without having anywhere for them to stay.""
A post-mortem examination is being carried out to determine the cause of death of the man who died after being held at Manston.  A test indicated ""diphtheria may be the cause"" of his illness, government officials have said."
health	East Midlands Ambulance Service workers begin strike action over pay	"East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) workers have begun strike action as part of a national pay dispute with the government.
24-hour action from ambulance staff across most of England and Wales on Wednesday is expected to affect non life-threatening calls only.
In the East Midlands, the action by the GMB union - which started at 06:00 GMT - will involve up to 50% of staff.
EMAS said it would aim to minimise the impact of strike action on patients.
means patients who have non life-threatening conditions will have to wait longer for an ambulance.
NHS said ""where safe and appropriate"", those people might be asked to make their own way to hospital, but should seek advice from 111 or 999 before doing so. 
rike will end at 06:00 on Thursday, and is set to continue from 06:00 on 28 December, to 06:00 on 29 December.
Ferdousara Uddin, regional organiser from GMB, said: ""It's not just about pay. It's about understaffing and the cuts being made that put patients at risk.
""The ambulance services are running at deeply unsafe levels and under extreme pressure every day.
""We need action from the government and proper investment into the service.""
Ms Uddin added: ""You can see and hear for yourself - it's been fantastic. We've had people stopping to speak to the ambulance workers to show their support.
""They've dropped off food, or just to have a chat"". 
Melissa Farrell, 36, a paramedic on the picket line in Lincoln, said: ""On Friday night I was on the back of an ambulance outside Lincoln A&E for seven hours followed by nine-and-a-half hours on Saturday night.
""It's about better working conditions for staff and for the public.
""We want to help the public and at the moment our hands are tied while we're stuck outside A&E. We're unable to get to those who truly need us. 
""We are here in the event of a real emergency, but at the moment we're overloaded with going to things which could be helped by other means.""
Her colleague Ellie Flinton, 30, said: ""There's a national shortage of nurses, paramedics, healthcare workers and we want the pay to be attractive so that people want to come into this job.
""We want our pay to be representative of what we do so people want to stay as well.
""In my opinion there are lives being put at risk every single day because of the way the service is currently running.""
One paramedic based in Nottinghamshire told PA News that patients' lives had been at risk ""longer than these strikes were even considered"".
m, 33, who did not want to provide his last name, said: ""I've attended elderly patients who have been on the floor with broken hips for over 20 hours.
""They've been waiting that long that their limbs have started to become necrotic (dying tissue), resulting in major surgery to remove said limbs.""
""In 14 hours I saw and attended one patient of my own and did not have a break... And there were, at one point, 11 ambulances stuck at (the) hospital unable to be freed back onto the road.
""The conditions we work in on a regular basis don't enable us to do the job we want to do to its full capacity and is putting patients' lives at risk long before strikes were even considered.
""We regularly go 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 hours without a break or even so much as a brew or any warm food, or food at all, due to these delays.""
""The ambulance service striking is one that has very little bearing on the grand scheme of things but hopefully has a big influence on highlighting the already failing NHS we so desperately need to treasure and invest in."" 
By Rob Sissons, BBC East Midlands Today health correspondent 
Another day, another strike. On Wednesday, it is the turn of ambulance workers and at England's second biggest ambulance trust.
re is a degree of apprehension about how the day will pan out. It is the GMB union that is striking with hundreds of members across many grades of staff from ambulance paramedics to call handlers. The ambulance service has always been about managing risk triaging 999 calls - those risks increase dramatically when a swathe of staff are missing on strike. 
GMB union says relations with the trust are good and they will liaise across the day. If there is a life-threatening emergency and no nearby ambulances, some strikers could be asked to come back to work. 
All disputes eventually come to an end but in the case of NHS workers, it feels like we in so many ways are stuck at the beginning. The government insists the pay claims are unaffordable in the current economic context. 
All sides are fighting for the hearts and minds of the public.
government has said it stands by a pay offer recommended by the independent pay review body and has criticised how the strike has been organised.
East Midlands Ambulance Service is made up of more than 4,000 workers represented by the GMB, Unison and Unite unions.
Unison has 1,296 staff at EMAS - made up of the likes of paramedics, technicians, call centre staff and mechanics.
Its members are not striking as the BBC understands they were 40 votes short of meeting the 50% threshold for action. 
New ballot papers for its members will be issued in the new year.
Ben Holdaway, director of operations at EMAS, said: ""During the period of the dispute, we will do all we can to minimise the impact on patient safety and will continue to work very closely with trade union colleagues, regional service providers and NHS employers.
""Patients should continue to call for an ambulance as normal if they experience a life-threatening emergency and should continue to access other more appropriate services for any other illnesses or injuries.
""We fully respect the right of NHS staff to take lawful and peaceful industrial action, however we do urge national employer representatives and trade union colleagues to proactively engage and reach a negotiated settlement to the dispute as quickly as possible.""
mes as a ""critical incident"" was declared across Nottinghamshire, due to high demand for hospital services. 
Operations have been cancelled, with nurses across the country also walking out on Tuesday.

health	Bristol team developing 'smart' menstrual cup and app	"A ""smart"" menstrual cup is being developed that aims to help empower women to get appropriate medical treatment and diagnosis.   
'Emm' cup is being developed by a Bristol team and is a reusable cup made from medical-grade silicone.
Currently in the second phase of testing, it is set to be launched in 2023.
GP and menopause expert Dr Julia Balfour said the Emm cup could reduce the need for invasive medical testing.
roduct aims to track the flow, volume, rate and regularity of menstruation and has sensors that connect with a smart phone app.
It has been designed to allow the user to track irregularities or changes in their cycle that could indicate a health issue, and its developers say it can also tell the user when the cup needs emptying.
Dr Balfour said certain female health conditions currently require invasive testing procedures and it would be ""lovely to imagine a world where this is being done effortlessly by a menstrual cup"".
CEO and founder Jenny Button said she had seen an opportunity to create a product that allowed women to ""non-invasively"" track their reproductive health.
""I wanted better health outcomes for women with the gender health gap,"" she said.
She said menstrual blood was rich in ""biomarkers"", which can provide information about health.
However, she said many woman were unable to identify reproductive symptoms due to not having access to their own menstrual health data.
One of the most common reasons women visit their doctor is due to heavy bleeding, says Ms Button, adding that one in five women suffer from menorrhagia - a condition that causes heavy menstrual bleeding.
""No one has the information on their menstrual volume at present, so diagnosis requires invasive tests or individual subjective recall of product usage."" 
Ms Button also hopes to encourage more women to transition to menstrual cups, reducing the number of period products that go to landfill each year.

health	South Western Ambulance Service declares critical incident	"South Western Ambulance Service has declared a critical incident after having 700 calls waiting to be dispatched on Tuesday.
rvice will take various measures, such as cancelling staff training, to address demand, according to BBC West health correspondent Matthew Hill. 
It comes on the eve of the first ambulance strike in over 30 years ago set for Wednesday, 21 December.
usands of staff are taking action in a dispute over pay and staffing levels.
BBC understands even at the busiest times pre-pandemic the service would be used to half the number of calls it received on Tuesday.
People have already been urged to only call 999 in life-threatening emergencies ahead of the strike action. 
Staff will leave the picket line for emergencies, union Unison said.
A government minister said if people need an ambulance they ""should most definitely seek that in the usual way"". 
m Pursglove, a minister for disabled people, health and work, said it was ""absolutely essential"" that ministers continue to engage with the unions. 
""But also that the NHS works tirelessly in local areas to make sure that the right cover is in place,"" he added.
government has said that about 1,200 members of the military and 1,000 civil servants will be drafted in to cover for striking ambulance and Border Force staff over Christmas.
Speaking ahead of Wednesday's strike action, Will Warrender, chief executive at the service, said they were ""sorry"" for any delays in response times.
""The public can help us by only calling 999 for life-threatening emergencies, we absolutely must have crews available for the most life-threatening conditions and we will be prioritising these patients,"" he added.
He asked people not to call back asking for an estimated time of arrival of an ambulance and said that if a patient's condition is not life-threatening they may be directed to alternative services.
Mr Warrender spoke as the service said there were 420 patients waiting for ambulances across the area on Monday, with 152 ambulances outside hospitals waiting to handover patients.
Kevin Stephens, from Gloucestershire, waited for more than 15 hours with his mother for an ambulance after her GP said she might have deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and needed to go to hospital. 
Speaking to BBC West, he said: ""She is housebound so we couldn't drive her there or take a taxi. 
""When we got there they found she had a blood and urine infection - she wasn't able to have a scan for the DVT because the equipment wasn't working.""
She later spent the a night on a reclining chair because there was not a bed available before she was transferred to a ward, he said.
Mr Stephens said he had ""mixed emotions"" about the strike because he is ""very worried"" about his mother but is also ""very angry about the state the health care system is in"". 
""I don't blame the NHS workers for this,"" he said.
""Thousands of people up and down the country are really suffering. Our NHS is broken and it needs to be fixed.""
As well as planned strike action, cold weather and busy hospitals are putting increasing pressure on the service, the ambulance service said.
Chris Hewett, from Unison, said there were ambulance stations are spread out across the South West and ""we're confident that our Unison members who are on the picket line will want to respond to any emergencies in their local communities"".

politics	Would pay demands cost an extra £28bn?	"Faced with a wave of strikes this winter, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was asked what more he could do to head them off.
Mr Sunak said the government had accepted the recommendations of the public sector pay review bodies but added: ""What I'm not going to do is ask ordinary families up and down the country to pay an extra £1,000 a year to meet the pay demands of the union bosses.""
Health Secretary Steve Barclay has also used this figure, telling BBC Breakfast on 7 December: ""If everyone in the public sector had a pay rise in line with inflation, it would cost an extra £28bn, an extra £1,000 per household.""
But, in terms of the current dispute, these figures look too high. 
ublic sector pay bill for all 5.7 million employees was around £233bn last year.
Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts average inflation for 2022-23 of about 10%. A rise for public sector workers in line with this would cost about £23bn.
re are 28 million households in the UK, so that's about £820 per household.
But there's something else to consider, as Ben Zaranko from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has pointed out.
""The government was already planning to give non-zero pay awards when it set out its spending plans last autumn,"" he told Reality Check.
It was already budgeting for a 3% average pay rise for the public sector for 2022-23 - remember, both the prime minister and the health secretary talked about how much ""extra"" would have to be paid. 
Once this is factored in, the IFS estimates that increasing it to match inflation of 10% would cost about £18bn - around £640 per household. 
And there's also the question of the tax public sector workers would be paying if they got an inflation-linked pay deal.
If it cost the government £18bn, it would be getting some of this back through tax - roughly a third - bringing the bill down further.
On 7 December, we asked the Treasury how it came up with the £28bn and £1,000 per family (or household) figures. 
On 9 December, it said they were calculated for an inflation-linked pay deal in 2023-24, whereas our calculations are for 2022-23.
government got to its higher figure by:
We asked the government why its figures were for 2023-24, when the strikes and disputes are over pay settlements in the current year?
It said these were appropriate given that pay has been set for this year and we are nine months through the pay year for most workforces.
But some questions remain:
Why is the government taking an inflation figure from October 2022 and applying it to a pay deal in 2023-24?
Ben Zaranko, from the IFS, points out that CPI inflation is forecast by the OBR to average 5.5% in 2023/24. 
""So it doesn't make sense to apply the current rate of CPI inflation to a pay award next year"", he told us.
He suggested that the right number to use, under the government's methodology, would be ""more like £14 billion"".
And why would families be asked to pay ""an extra £1,000 a year""?
We don't know quite what Mr Sunak means by this. 
If he means an extra £1,000 in tax to fund this pay deal, it's worth pointing out that taxes such as income tax and national insurance are not evenly distributed throughout the population.
Some families don't pay any and the amount of tax paid by those who do, varies widely.

politics	Don't believe it's back to boring, says Laura Kuenssberg	"After the last few years - let alone the last few weeks - you can see why Michael Gove has said in a speech that he is grateful ""boring is back"". 
Mr Gove, who has returned to cabinet as levelling up secretary and appears on this week's programme, made the comments at the London Press Club awards.
You too might feel relief that the crazy period of the Truss administration has come to an end, and that in Rishi Sunak we seem to have a prime minister who doesn't revel in scrapes and scandals, who doesn't have making headlines at the top of his to-do list. Now who might we be talking about?  
One of his ministers told me that Sunak had ""ended the Tory psychodrama with a careful reshuffle of all the talents and a focus on delivery"", saying it was a sign of the recent turmoil that commentators see that as ""boring"". ""It's actually serious government,"" they added.
Another of his MPs, who did not find a berth in government, had a less flattering assessment, saying: ""He's managed to appoint to some of the dullest people in Parliament to ministerial jobs, so if anybody can succeed in being boring, it's some of these people."" Ouch!  
It is true that we are at the start of a very different era. From 2015 until last month at least one of our big political parties has been led by a deeply unconventional leader.
Jeremy Corbyn's time in office turned Labour upside down. Boris Johnson as the Tory boss provided a daily soap opera. 
Much of the soundtrack to the last seven years has been noisy internal chaos for one - or sometimes both - of Labour and the Conservatives.  
Sunak vs Starmer creates a different atmosphere altogether. The biggest beasts in our politics are now described by colleagues as ""sensible"" and ""measured"". They are both known by their teams to be extremely hard working and diligent.  
f-perpetuating Tory circus has gone, the ring master retired after the crowd didn't clamour for more. And as one government insider notes, both main party leaders ""are keen to establish themselves for their competence rather than political pyrotechnics"". But that is not the same as ""boring"" for several significant reasons. 
Firstly, we are not living in a time when things are ticking over nicely and government can just trundle along. The choices the new prime minister has to make about the economy are huge. 
Watch: Rishi Sunak's first PMQs in the top job... in 64 seconds
And it can't have escaped your notice - with Jeremy Hunt's sober tones, or countless briefings to journalists about the scary size of the black hole in the public finances - that cuts are coming, even if they end up being less grim than the scariest warnings suggest. 
We'll only know the likely result of those decisions when the chancellor gets to the despatch box on 17 November. We can be sure that it won't be pretty. But the decisions for Mr Sunak go way beyond the choices he has to make about the economy, and they are certainly not ""boring"". 
With millions on waiting lists, social care creaking, the risk of blackouts this winter and climate change, choices have to be made fast on a vast range of issues, and those decisions will have massive consequences for us all. 
And while Mr Sunak's approach on the economy is widely known, his broader instincts are less well understood.  
job is huge, according to another government source, who says: ""We have to get five years' worth of work done in about two."" 
But will it be dull? They add: ""It will be calmer and more stable, but to say Sunak is boring is wrong. He actually has quite an innovative way of looking at things so will shake things up, but in a well thought through way.""  
's an optimistic way of looking at it. One Whitehall source describes him differently, as ""the least experienced prime minister we have had in recent history"". Additionally, as chancellor it was possible for him - as others before him - to stay out of sight for long periods of time.  
Successive new prime ministers and their teams have started out with the intention of being less visible, popping up less, determined to concentrate on the job and their priorities rather than get caught up in frippery or spend time on events that don't match their agenda. 
want to avoid the surreal spectacle of Tony Blair once giving a view on the fortunes of fictional Coronation Street character, Deirdre Rachid. If you are lucky enough not to remember this, it really did happen, as this BBC story from the time shows.  
But successive teams who have entered No 10 with that intention find out that in the real world, they can dictate and control far less than they hope. Life comes at them fast, 24 hours a day, from 360 degrees.  
Mr Sunak has discovered already this week with his first visit, to a hospital. 
re were planned images of him chatting to patients, showing empathy and giving a brief clip to broadcasters on the issues of the day - but it was memorable not because of that, but because a patient took him to task, wagging her finger at him for not paying nurses enough. That encounter was not boring.  
Rishi Sunak says it is right he ""focuses on the... pressing domestic challenges"" the UK faces in its economy rather than got to COP27.
And whether it's on health, the environment, welfare, foreign affairs or other issues, it is hard to know where the new prime minister's political reflexes will lie.  
A Whitehall source who has worked alongside him says he ""is sensible, but not a centrist"", and he may surprise some even of his own supporters by erring to the right.  
Politics is about principles, and we'd all want our leaders to be deeply serious about how they make decisions, but it is also about instinct.  
urce, who has served successive prime ministers, wonders if his character will be well suited for the crucible of Downing Street.
""Boris came to reasonable decisions, but made them in a crazy way and didn't stick to them, Liz neither made the right decisions nor made them in a sensible way,"" they said. 
""He [Sunak] will make them in a sensible way, and it will make a difference. But given the way he delves into detail, how will he cope with the span of the job? You can't do a spreadsheet on every issue when you are the prime minister.""
And while he might be generally seen as sensible, Mr Sunak has already willingly walked into a political controversy that is far from dull. 
He hired back Suella Braverman as home secretary just days after she had been fired for breaking the rules for ministers. She had used her personal email to send government documents to a colleague, and they also ended up with someone else by mistake.  
Holding his carefully constructed government together prevents a huge challenge for the new leader, and it's simply not clear yet if he has the political ability to do that with long-term success. Could anyone?  
Conservatives concluded, less than a week ago, that after all the drama, Mr Sunak was their best option. The impulse to survive after the trauma of the Truss explosion led them to choose the candidate closest to being seen as a safe pair of hands.  
With a smart team around him, a party exhausted by arguing with itself, and a personal reputation for being extremely capable and hardworking, that could turn out to be true.  
But there is nothing remotely guaranteed about that coming to pass, nor is there any certainty that the Sunak premiership will be a success. And however much Conservatives might hope for dull stability, it certainly will not be boring for the rest of us to find out.  "

politics	Qatar World Cup: Welsh government boycotts Wales-Iran game	"A Welsh government minister who was expected to attend Wales' World Cup match with Iran will stay at home due to recent protests in the country. 
It was the only group match in Qatar Deputy Sport Minister Dawn Bowden was due to go to. 
First Minister Mark Drakeford and Economy Minister Vaughan Gething are still attending other World Cup ties.
Qatar has faced criticism in the build-up to the tournament for multiple human rights concerns. 
ude its laws against same-sex relationships, as well as how it treats women and foreign workers. 
Welsh government said it will still attend matches with the US and England, where they say ministers can ""share our interests and values""
BBC Wales was told the decision was due to the recent events in Iran and was not related to the wider debate about whether the entire visit to Qatar was appropriate.
Ms Bowden could attend future matches if Wales advance beyond the group stage, but it is not confirmed.
match against Iran is taking place at 10:00 GMT on 25 November in Al-Rayyan. 
Iran has been criticised internationally for its response to protests sparked by the death of a young woman arrested by the country's morality police.
Welsh government said: ""Welsh ministers will be attending the Wales games against the USA and England, as these represent the most significant opportunities for us to raise the profile of Wales and make connections where we can share our interests and values.
""Ministers will have a full programme of events and meetings to take advantage of this unique opportunity. 
""Welsh ministers will not be attending the Iran game and will be supporting Wales from home.""
Mr Drakeford is expected to attend the fixture against the US, while Mr Gething is planning to go to the England game.
Some gay Welsh fans have said they will stay away from the tournament, and earlier this week Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey criticised Mark Drakeford's decision to go to the tournament.. 
His comments sparked a robust Twitter response from Plaid Cymru MS and Senedd presiding officer Elin Jones, who said it was ""absolutely"" right for Mr Drakeford to attend.
""Our football team is there, so should he be. None of us wanted Qatar to host,"" she said.
As well as supporting Wales' first World Cup appearance since 1958, the Welsh government wants to use the event to raise the country's profile on the world stage.
Mr Drakeford's stance contradicts that of UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who is boycotting the event.
In September, Mr Gething told the Senedd that he, Mr Drakeford and Ms Bowden would attend a ""range of events"", as well as ""each of Wales' group games against the USA, Iran and England"".
Asked if he had considered a boycott, he said: ""We've considered all options, but we think it's the right thing for ministers to go, to support our team, and to make the very best of the opportunity that it is, both in terms of what it does for Wales on the stage, but also in that positive point about projecting and being proud of our values today.""
On Thursday a senior Welsh Labour MP, Rhondda's Chris Bryant, retweeted a report extremely critical of the treatment of LGBT people in Qatar, said: ""This is why no UK officials should be going to the World Cup.""
He did not name any of the Welsh ministers attending.
One Labour politician told BBC Wales they thought Mr Drakeford should not be attending: ""But I get why he is going for Wales"".
But they criticised the planned attendance of two other ministers as a ""pointless waste of money"".
Another Labour elected politician said while as a football fan they were happy that Mr Drakeford was attending, as someone who cared about human rights they were not.
Some Labour backbench Senedd members defended the trip.
Hefin David, Caerphilly MS, said while the event should have never been held in Qatar ""there are good reasons for Wales' government"" to be at the tournament.
John Griffiths, MS for Newport East, said: ""This is an opportunity that might not come along again for some time.""
Welsh Conservative sport spokesman Tom Giffard said: ""The Labour party can't quite decide whether or not they are going to be attending the Qatar World Cup. The hypocrisy is clear for all to see.""
He added that he hoped Mr Drakeford would still go to Qatar: ""It is right however, that the Welsh team are fully supported in their first World Cup since the 1950s.""
Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: ""Iran's human rights record is atrocious and we welcome this [decision]. 
""However, Qatar's is equal as abysmal and the Welsh government shouldn't be sending any Ministers to Qatar itself."""
politics	The local battles behind Tory housing divisions	"""We don't have enough new, purpose-built homes for people in my situation""
government has agreed to water down housing targets for local councils in the face of a rebellion from nearly 60 of its own MPs. But not everyone is happy - some Tories are worried this could lead to fewer homes being built and make it even harder for people to get on the housing ladder. At a local level, new developments provoke passionate views on both sides. 
""Unless I'm prepared to move 100 miles north of here then it's really unlikely I'll be able to get on the housing ladder,"" says Sheldon Allen. 
21-year-old, who is president of Reading University's Students' Union and a Labour activist, is currently renting a room in the town centre for £625 a month.
With bills to pay on top of that he says ""it's a real struggle to make ends meet"".
Sheldon thinks building more homes would help bring down the cost of renting and buying. 
""Ultimately I don't think we have enough new, purpose-built homes for people in my situation and others like me,"" he says.
But in the nearby borough of Wokingham in Berkshire, some locals are angry about the idea of more homes being built in the area. 
""I'm not against houses per se. We've had a lot of housing development in this area,"" says Paul Stevens. ""We feel we've done our bit.""
Paul started a campaign group against plans to build up to 4,500 new homes on an area of land just south of Reading. 
group argues the area lacks the infrastructure needed for a major housing development and risks causing flooding and traffic problems. 
""We're potentially tearing up valuable farmland and growth space to fill it with concrete,"" says Andy Bailey, another member of the group. ""It's sacrilege - this should simply not be happening.""
Local campaigners on housebuilding plans: ""It's sacrilege - this should simply not be happening""
University of Reading, which is one of the owners of the land, says: ""We believe we've put forward a good plan that would provide homes, community facilities, and jobs in creative, heritage and high-tech sectors.""
However, a spokesman adds: ""We recognise this is a difficult balancing act, and we welcome discussion about what's best for everyone.""
A spokeswoman for Wokingham Borough Council says draft development plans were prepared by the previous Conservative administration and the council is gathering evidence before setting out the next stages, with no decisions made yet.
Paul does not dispute that there needs to be more affordable housing for young people but says the homes being built in the area are too expensive to solve the problem. 
""My son couldn't afford to live around here. He couldn't afford to buy anywhere,"" he says. 
""These houses are not being built for young people, they're being built for old people who are escaping London.""
Wokingham's Conservative MP John Redwood was among nearly 60 Tories backing a plan to ban mandatory housebuilding targets in England. 
rebels say targets are undermining local decision-making and mean homes aren't built in the right places.
Housing Secretary Michael Gove has now offered councils more flexibility over meeting the government-set targets to ""reflect local circumstances"". 
He told MPs the targets should be ""an advisory starting point"" rather than mandatory. 
rebels have welcomed the change in position, with Mr Redwood saying it will give councils and local communities a role in deciding what is ""sustainable and appropriate"". 
But other Tories have argued weakening targets would mean fewer houses are built, which they say would be politically damaging for the party. 
government says it's still committed to the national target, set out in the 2019 Conservative manifesto, to build 300,000 homes a year in England by the mid-2020s. 
However, it's on track to miss that target, with the figure remaining below 250,000 in recent years. 
Clive Jones, the Liberal Democrat leader of Wokingham Borough Council, says he is ""cautiously optimistic"" above the government's agreement with the rebels but ""the devil is always in the detail"". 
He is hopeful the change will mean local people can decide the level of housing they want in their area. 
Under the current government-calculated targets, Wokingham needs to build around 800 new homes a year up to 2036. 
Mr Jones says this is too many. 
""We have provided 40,000 new homes in the last 40 years and most people will say that is too much. Enough is enough,"" he says. 
""A lot of people have moved here in the last 40 years. They moved here because they like to be in a semi-rural area because that is what Wokingham is.
""It's changing and it's changing too fast for lots of people. It's becoming like a suburb of south London… and that is not what people want.""
Conservatives lost control of the council in May after two decades in charge - although they remain the largest party. 
Lib Dems now run the council in coalition with Labour and Independent councillors. 
Mr Jones says overdevelopment was one of the big issues which contributed to May's local election result. 
He is standing as the Lib Dem candidate for Wokingham in the next general election, which is due in two years' time. 
Mr Jones believes if the current level of development in Wokingham continues it will be a close fight between the Lib Dems and Conservatives, who currently hold the seat with a majority of 7,383. 
""It won't just be housing - it will be the cost-of living-crisis, it will be the crisis in social care,"" he says.
""All of those things coming together are going to make it very difficult for the Conservatives to hold on to this part of Berkshire.""
Even if local targets are made more flexible, Mr Jones says it won't affect developments which have already been approved. 
""[The Conservatives] have forced all of this housing on us over the past 10 years. We have got loads of outstanding planning permissions which will then be built out so there isn't going to suddenly be no more building here.""

sports	Georgina Roberts: Shooting's absence from Commonwealth Games 'a real blow'	"Welsh trap shooter Georgina Roberts is hoping to put her Commonwealth Games disappointment behind her at the first ISSF World Cup event of the year.
Roberts fulfilled selection criteria, but the 2022 Games in Birmingham will be without shooting for the first time since 1970 in Edinburgh.
24-year-old instead now travels to Cyprus to try the new World Cup format.
""Birmingham 2022 would have been my first Games and shooting not being involved was a real blow,"" she said.
""It would have been at a range we've been training at so the chances for myself and other teammates medalling would have been incredibly high.
""It's such a shame to have wasted that opportunity.""
India had originally threatened to boycott the Games if shooting wasn't included - even offering to host the shooting and archery competitions themselves - before abandoning the plan due to Covid-19 in July 2021.
Of Wales' 36 medals at the 2018 Games in Gold Coast, five were won in shooting events - the same haul as in athletics and swimming, and one less than cycling events. 
Despite her disappointment, the Mold shooter is keeping focused on her next goals.
week's event in Cyprus sees a change of format with competitors shooting at 125 targets across three days of qualifying.
rs then progress to the semi-finals and final, which take place on the third day.
""This year is now about ramping up to Paris 2024 [Olympics],"" said Roberts.
""We've got to work towards getting a place for that and then focus on the ultimate goal, an Olympic gold medal.
""All we can do is be positive for the future, keep working towards how we can champion our sport so next time we're likely to be back at the Commonwealth Games.""
Roberts' first competition win was in Malaga back in January 2020, and Roberts is keen to get back on track with her lofty ambitions.
""I'm a very optimistic and ambitious person,"" she added.
""Olympic gold is my dream and if I could do it in Paris I'd be the happiest person in the world.
""I think the thing I love about our sport is longevity, there's no age limit you can continue to go and medal at the Olympics, some have gone into their 50s.
""I want a final, I want a medal and I want a gold in Paris, but it's the getting there the really hard part.
""I'm hoping that, if I get there, I can medal and qualify got Los Angeles [2028] and future Olympic Games after that."""

sports	URC: Edinburgh 25-32 Glasgow Warriors - Horne stars as visitors win 1872 Cup	"Glasgow Warriors beat Edinburgh 32-25 to secure a second United Rugby Championship win over their Scottish rivals and the 1872 Cup.
Emiliano Boffelli kicked the hosts into an eight-point lead at the break after two tries for each team, Jamie Ritchie and Luke Crosbie for Edinburgh and Kyle Steyn and Matt Fagerson for Glasgow.
m Jordan's converted try and 13 points from George Horne put Warriors back in front and ensured them a bonus point, Patrick Harrison replying for Edinburgh.
Warriors, who won 16-10 last Friday, move up a place to fifth in the league.
Edinburgh were so passive for so long in round one at Scotstoun that there was only way for them to go in round two. After three losses in a row in the URC they desperately needed a victory to get themselves back up the table.
It did not start well for them and it finished nightmarishly but in between they had good moments and a handsome lead before their demons swooped and destroyed them.
Having come into this full of fire and brimstone they shipped an early try. Sione Tuipulotu was immense all night, even when Glasgow toiled for the first 40.
re gave the visitors good field position with a big line break. Glasgow worked it right, then left, Steyn's footwork proving too much for a flimsy Edinburgh defence. Jordan's conversion made it 7-0 and Mike Blair's team were back in bother.
r discomfort did not last long. They found an aggression and a control that garnered 17 points without reply. Home-free? One might have thought so.
Glasgow were not at the races in that period. Edinburgh got their first try after Ali Price was charged down while attempting a box kick in his own 22. His team-mates were sluggish in trying to claim the loose ball and when the hosts jumped on it, Ritchie soon ploughed over. Boffelli, inevitably, fired over the conversion.
Argentine added a penalty to make it 10-7, The gap would have been wider had Sebastian Cancelliere not done wonderfully well to get under Duhan van der Merwe over the try line.
r pressure did tell in the end, though. Glasgow, as passive in the first half here as they were steely last week, could not defend a driven lineout, Crosbie crashing over with Boffelli landing a beauty of a conversion from out wide. The crowd of more than 25,000 were lapping it up.
re was an occasional sign of life from Glasgow, normally provided by the dump truck Tuipulotu. Another surge, where Edinburgh bounced off him as if he was a human wall, took Glasgow downfield and they stayed there until Fagerson scored from a smart play off a lineout.
Boffelli put over a penalty just before the break. Edinburgh should have been further ahead and, given their history this season, eight points was a precarious advantage.
Blair's side have had a wretched habit of coughing up decent leads and the ghost of defeats revisited them when Glasgow suddenly got a foothold.
Just before the hour they scored their third try from not far off their third proper attack. It was a pearler. Richie Gray, Sione Vailanu and Cancelliere combined at pace down the right. The wing then put in Jordan for the score, the fly-half then landing the conversion to make it 20-19.
Glasgow now had the bit between their teeth, the momentum completely shifting in their favour. They hit the lead with 13 minutes left with a Horne penalty, given away by Marshall Sykes under his own posts. Sykes was yellow carded for good measure.
Another Edinburgh collapse? Not half. Just as they were gathering their senses having fallen behind, they conceded again. Again it was the outstanding Tuipulotu in the thick of it. His grubber was seized on by Steyn, who gathered, ran on and fed his support runner. Horne took the key pass from Jordan and ran away to score. A ruthless finish from a player who had a seismic influence when he replaced Price.
Edinburgh were stunned. Horne added another penalty to bring his own haul to 13 points in seven spectacular minutes. From there, they never looked like showing the weakness in their game that Edinburgh showed in theirs. Harrison sneaked over on the right to give Edinburgh some comfort.
re hugely encouraging days for Franco Smith's side and enormously worrying times for Edinburgh, who are now on a grim run of four URC losses in a row.
Edinburgh head coach Mike Blair: ""It was really disappointing to see what happened in the second half. Glasgow got on top from a physicality point of view and we struggled.
""The tightness of the league means that if you do get on a run, you're back in the play-off positions. We need to keep that belief. This has been a tough period for us - lots of guys have played five games on the bounce. We'll have to look at freshening things up.""
Glasgow head coach Franco Smith: ""It was fantastic. Everybody has chipped in and worked really hard. There's a lot of belief now. We fought well. The character of the boys - if we play to our strengths, we are a dangerous team.
""[Sione Tuipulotu] was really good. He's put up his hand for a lot of responsibility this season and he led the charge.""

technology	Why is Elon Musk spending his time on Twitter, not on the mission to Mars?	"I have been watching Elon Musk for a number of years - and more closely than ever in recent months, since he decided, seemingly on a whim, to buy the social network Twitter.
He is one of the world's richest men - sometimes the richest, depending on the price of Tesla shares, his main financial asset. With a string of other high-profile companies under his wing, including Tesla, Space X, Starlink, and Neuralink, he is also a subject of global fascination. 
, of course, there is his own personal story - the tall, 51-year-old billionaire with 10 children ranging in age from one to 18. His first son died aged just 10 weeks. Musk, who was born in South Africa, has described living with Asperger's syndrome, a type of autism, and stated that his main goal in life is to colonise Mars. 
What I have learned is - as, perhaps, with many of us - there are many different faces of Elon Musk.
rsona he projects via his prolific tweets is provocative, controversial and bombastic. He loves a rude meme, knows whatever he says will make headlines around the world, and enjoys trolling the media with ever more outlandish statements and jokes. He likes trying to goad us journalists into writing ever more extreme headlines.
In public, he has learned to be a showman, whether dancing alongside electric-car-making robots, emerging triumphantly from the latest slick Tesla prototype, or being filmed walking into Twitter's headquarters carrying a sink - ""Let that sink in"" was the gag, playing off a popular meme on the site. This Halloween, he attended a party in leather armour, a $7,500 costume called ""the devil's champion"".
And yet Tallulah Riley, his ex-wife, whom he married twice, described him in BBC documentary series The Elon Musk Show as ""sweet"" and ""shy"". 
Veteran Silicon Valley journalist and author Mike Malone, who has known Mr Musk for 20 years, tells me he sees  ""a very reserved, very smart, very introspective and intellectual guy"" who spends long transatlantic flights with him reading complex trajectory tables, trying to work out how to land a spacecraft on Mars. 
r have a long-standing $5 (£4) bet over Mr Musk's ambition to send people to Mars by 2030. ""I said, 'I don't think you can do it - but I hope you do. I hope I owe you the $5,'"" Mr Malone says. ""That bet's still floating in the air"".
Sending people to Mars is a lifelong goal for Mr Musk. Some say it is his take on long-termism - a philosophy favoured by some very rich people which seeks to act in the interests of billions of people in the far future, rather than focusing on the immediate needs of the present.
At some point, the human race is going to have to leave Earth, he says. And his interest in space is clearly signposted in his existing business portfolio. But where, on Earth, does Twitter fit in? 
Mr Musk answered that question, this week - in a tweet.
""Social media in general, especially Twitter, were eroding civilisation,"" he wrote. ""If civilisation collapses before Mars becomes self-sustaining, then nothing else matters. Human consciousness is gone.""
But how was Twitter ""eroding civilisation""? 
Mr Musk said, at the very beginning, his aim in buying the platform was to create a 21st Century digital, global town square for discussing society's big issues. 
He has written many times about perceived imbalance under the previous regime, arguing that right-leaning views were given less visibility by Twitter staff than left-leaning ones, skewing debate and creating echo chambers where nobody saw material that challenged their existing viewpoint. With some handpicked journalists, he published the ""Twitter files"", a selected set of internal documents, to support his view.
mount of abuse and misinformation thrown around on the platform could also be seen as distracting from the real issues Mr Musk wants discussed.
But as anyone who has ever tried will know, navigating that tightrope between allowing free speech and suppressing hateful content is very, very hard.
Maybe there is a connection somewhere in Mr Musk's mind between Twitter and Neuralink, which is trying to create a direct link between human brains and computers. 
Could it be that Twitter forms part of his research and he has essentially bought himself a living, breathing neural network of 300 million people sharing their lives, and opinions, in real time, online? 
OK, we are in the realms of science fiction. But transporting that to another planet in some form would be one way of taking human consciousness away from Earth - and we know Mr Musk likes a challenge.
Mr Malone may never see his $5 - and betting against Mr Musk is generally a bad idea, entrepreneur Dolly Singh, who worked with him for six years at SpaceX, until 2013, says.
""I would, by rule, never bet against him,"" she says.
""Anything that's a machine - hands down, he's going to win.""  
But Ms Singh also thinks Twitter presents her former boss with a different challenge. 
""This is going to be harder than he has anticipated - and it's going to be a lot of work for him,"" she says.
Mr Musk has talked openly about preferring engineering and code to people. Growing up, he did not understand people did not necessarily say what they meant, he told a Technology, Entertainment, Design (Ted) conference in Vancouver, last year.
In a text message, released as part of court papers for a legal case against Twitter that never actually happened, he wrote: ""I interface way better with engineers who are able to do hardcore programming than with program managers/MBA [Master of Business Administration] types of people and/or frankly I hate doing mgmt [management] stuff. I kinda don't think anyone should be the boss of anyone. But I love helping solve technical/product design problems.""
His problem is that Twitter is one huge messy network of millions of people shouting, laughing, teasing, trolling, arguing - loud, complex and nuanced. 
Mr Musk has already struggled with trying to moderate it, even with a promise of a lighter touch than the previous regime. 
And Ms Singh is not the only observer to ask whether he will find it more difficult to run smoothly than he imagined. 
As a businessman and a leader, he can be brutal - although arguably no more so than other chief executives. 
Within one week of buying Twitter, he had laid off half the workforce. Those remaining were asked to sign contracts committing to an ""intense"" work ethic and long hours. 
Pre-Twitter, he was one of the first to call for the staff of all his companies to be back at the workplace full time following pandemic lockdowns. 
And he will not tolerate less than 100% commitment from his employees.
Ms Singh describes the Musk she knew as an ""incredible leader"", determined to ""prove everybody wrong"" when told he cannot achieve something, and, as is often said about him, a phenomenally hard worker.
""Elon wants to live in a world where he works 80 hours a week,"" she says.
""It's OK for him to say, 'I expect you to work as hard as me,' because he's not phoning it in from the beach, he's sleeping in a sleeping bag on the factory floor.""
Most people, she says, burn out after a while. He does not.
He has installed beds in Twitter's San Francisco headquarters, seemingly for his staff - although, he is understood to be sleeping there himself. He even shared a picture of his two-year-old son, X, wearing a company pass. 
Others who worked with him in the 1990s also recall his extraordinary work ethic. He was furious, one said, to find nobody in the office at 21:00 on a Friday night.
Ms Singh says his time is Mr Musk's most precious commodity. 
""Think about what it's worth, per second,"" she says. 
You do not need to do the maths to know it is eye-watering. 
And right now, he is pouring it all into Twitter. 
Perhaps Mr Malone should not spend his $5 just yet.

technology	Robot with 'brain' near Cheltenham sorting plastic waste	"A waste management company is trialling the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to sort plastic waste.
Grundon has invested in a robotic arm at its Bishop's Cleeve site in Gloucestershire which can pick rubbish at ""a human rate"".
Zen Robotics machine learns to remember plastic in a similar way to which humans learn to recognise items.
mpany hopes the technology will increase the volume of recyclable material Grundon can capture.
'Fast Picker' arm is supplied by Helsinki-based supplier of robotic waste separation technology - Zen Robotics.
It works by scanning rubbish on a belt before deciding which items to pick - the robot then has an ""in-belt brain"" of information which it retains through training.
Over time, as more items are picked, the ""brain"" identifies more waste streams, storing the information in its AI memory.
Government statistics show the UK generated almost 44 million tonnes of commercial and industrial waste in 2018.
mate for England - in 2020 - was almost 34 million tonnes.
Once plastic trials are complete, Grundon will begin training the robot to pick steel or aluminium cans, paper and cardboard.
Ed Fagan, Grundon's head of projects, said: ""Both optical and robotic sorters can be deployed alongside humans in our waste sorting facilities.
""But where we can really see robotic sorters making a difference is in environments which are less well suited for humans, such as the sorting of contaminated waste or working in areas with high levels of noise and dust.""

technology	Ruja Ignatova: Leaked police notes may have alerted FBI-wanted Cryptoqueen	"Ruja Ignatova, also known as the ""missing Cryptoqueen"", received police information about investigations into her $4bn (£3.5bn) cryptocurrency fraud before she disappeared, it is claimed.
42-year-old Bulgarian-born woman is wanted for her alleged role in running a cryptocurrency scam known as OneCoin.
Files seen by the BBC from Europol meetings suggest the FBI-wanted fugitive knew about efforts to arrest her months before she vanished. 
uments were passed to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast by Frank Schneider, a former spy and trusted adviser to Ms Ignatova.
Mr Schneider denies obtaining the documents, which he says were passed to him on a USB memory stick by Ms Ignatova. He claims metadata on the files suggests she obtained the information via her own contacts in Bulgaria. 
He is now facing extradition to the US for his alleged role in the OneCoin fraud. 
Europol said it was looking into the issue. 
Ms Ignatova disappeared on 25 October 2017 after being tipped off about intensifying police investigations into her OneCoin cryptocurrency. In June 2022, she was added to the FBI's 10 most wanted list.
files contain presentations made at an ""Operation Satellite"" Europol meeting in The Hague on 15 March 2017.
According to the documents, the meeting was attended by the FBI, the US Department of Justice and the New York District Attorney. Officers from the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Dubai and Bulgaria were also present.
uments include details of US authorities having a ""high-placed confidential informant"", OneCoin bank accounts receiving investor funds, and unsuccessful efforts by the UK's City of London Police to interview Ms Ignatova.
FBI did not comment on the Europol documents, but Special Agent Paul Roberts told the podcast: ""There were investigations all around the world into her, and into OneCoin generally, many of which she had become aware of due to actions by law enforcement in other countries.""
In court, US prosecutors alleged in 2019 that Mr Schneider was the one who provided her with confidential police information, although it is not clear if the allegations relate specifically to the leaked files seen by the podcast.
He has denied obtaining the documents and said: ""When the Bulgarians participated at certain Europol meetings, it only took hours for her to get a complete rundown and get the minutes of what was said in those meetings.
""I can only deduce that it came from the circles that she was in and the connections that she had through a variety of influential personalities.""
uments show attendees from Bulgaria's Interior Ministry at the March 2017 Europol meeting. The BBC asked the ministry whether its staff could be responsible for the leak, but it did not comment. 
No other law enforcement bodies in attendance would confirm how the information got out. 
Europol told the BBC it was looking into the matter, adding: ""This complex scenario with many stakeholders makes it difficult to assess where and how such an incident might have occurred.""
US Department of Justice, New York County District Attorney's Office, and Dubai Police did not comment.
Listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast on BBC Sounds - the search for Dr Ruja Ignatova continues, with a new episode about the police leak out on 19 October.
