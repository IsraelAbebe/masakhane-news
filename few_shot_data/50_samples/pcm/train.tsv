Di opposition bin try, and fail, to push for secret ballot as dem sense say more members fit break ranks. But Tuesday win na only political, and not legally binding. Oga Ramaphosa go still need to get di Constitutional Court to weigh in on di mata, though some experts say di judges dey likely to side wit am afta parliament, wey commission di investigate, bin reject im own report. For now, on top of one huge sigh of relief, Oga Ramaphosa march on wit severe political bruises - im credibility and ability to govern go come into even sharper focus."

Dis fit shock you. While men dey pee from their penis, women dey pee from di urethra (one tubular structure wey dey carry piss from di bladder to outside of di body). From front to back, di first hole na di urethra and then di vagina, wey dey above di anus. Public hair get work wey e dey do. E dey serve as protective barrier to di genital tissues and vaginal opening. E also dey prevent infection. Obstetrician-gynaecologist, Dr Jen Gunter say she notice say plenty women dey like shave dia pubic hair. She say e dey okay but e get risk. Dr Gunter add join say waxing or shaving of di pubic hair fit cause microscopic trauma to di skin, plus e fit cause cuts, abrasions, infections. Many women dey shy to tok about di pain dem dey experience during kerewa [sex]. However, E dey important to know say sex no suppose dey painful. Sabi pipo advise say if you dey experience any kain pain during kerewa visit your doctor or gynaecologist. Di glands wey dey located for di lining of di vagina dey release one fluid wey naturally dey designed to dey lubricate and cleanse di vagina. When you use some kain soaps or cleaning devices, dem fit cause react wit di vagina natural pH balance and cause infections like thrush. To avoid dis, apply soap for di outer labia only. Dr Gunter say you no need use anything clean inside di vagina. She warn against using scented douches alias bathing soap as e fit increase di risk of catching sexually transmitted infections. Steaming, another trend, no dey necessary, e fit lead to burns. You fit clean di outer part of di vulval area when necessary wit water or a gentle cleanser. Vaginal cells dey replace themselves every 96 hours - e dey quick heal. You still fit catch some STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) even if you use condom. STDs like herpes, HPV, pubic lice and molluscum contagiosum still dey transferable. Dis na because di vulva still fit touch di blocus (or vice versa), during sex and dis fit cause infection. Most women no dey reach climax through vaginal penetration and sometimes dey need clitoral stimulation before dem fit experience orgasm. Dem fit achieve orgasm through masturbation, manual or cunnilingual stimulation by a sexual partner. Plenty lubrication of di vagina dey prevent painful sex and tissue tearing. Vaginal lubrication dey affected by di level of oestrogen for di body. Things like using birth control, menopause and breastfeeding fit change di oestrogen levels. Di lower your oestrogen levels, di more difficult e go dey for your vagina to lubricate naturally. As women dey grow old, di natural lubrication [wey be di wetness for di vagina] go dey dry up. Dem fit begin topical oestrogen treatments or manufactured vaginal lubricants to lubricate. If you get very dry vagina, you fit speak to your doctor and get solution. Whether you do operation (C-section) or you born naturally, most physicians dey recommend taking at least four to six weeks off before you begin kerewa, make di vagina for fit heal well-well. To dey get orgasm fit help relieve menstrual pain. Dis na because of di increase of blood flow wey dey occur during climaxing. In addition, when you orgasm, your uterine muscles go contract and release chemicals di brain wey go generate one natural pain reliever for menstrual cramps. Afta years of doing periods and maybe to born children, di ovaries go stop to dey produce eggs and menstruation go stop. Di amount of hormones for di body wey dey keep women fertile go drop dramatically - and low levels of oestrogen, in particular, dey affect di vagina and vulva. Vaginal farting [to mess] wey pipo sabi as ""queefing"", go happun to most women at some point for dia lives, especially during exercise and intercourse. Dis na because air dey escape from vagina and e go make dem dey mess. Pregnancy and childbirth fit change di vagina in plenty ways; Every single woman get different vagina odour sake of dia choice of fabric, from wetin dem like use as underwear, level of hygiene, diet, gland secretion and unique mix of internal bacteria. Di quality and quantity of vaginal discharge dey change sake of di different stages of your menstrual cycle. E usually dey be like off white wey look creamy tint when your cycle wan start. Small-small, di amount of discharge go dey increase as you dey near ovulation. When ovulation start, di discharge go dey thick small and e go dey pull when you touch am. E dey recommended make women do Kegel exercises afta dem born pikin to strengthen di vaginal muscles again.  Kegels dey easy to do and you fit do am anywhere at any time. In order for sperm to survive and swim inside di vagina, di vagina dey maintain acidic environment wit a pH balance of 4.5. Douching dey considered to be more harmful than beneficial as e dey disrupt di natural balance of bacteria and fit lead to infection. Most women no dey ejaculate during orgasm, but if you do, beta for you. Female ejaculation fit occur as di result of two different phenomena wey most pipo no sabi. Ejaculation dey produced in a small amount wit a milky or cloudy appearance, e dey comot from di paraurethral glands wey dey inside di urethra. for women wey dey experience ejaculation, di sensation dey orgasmic and e different from wen women dey piss. Dis two structures resemble well-well. Just like di penis, di clitoris get di frenulum (di small fold and ridge of di skin wey support di motion) and a prepuce (or 'clitoral hood' na fold of skin wey cover am). Di clitoral hood dey comprised of di same kind of tissues wey make up di foreskin for males. Like di penis, di clitoris get erectile tissues wey dey stand upon arousal. Every woman vulva dey different, some labia majora (outer lips) dey inside and some hang down, some dey symmetrical and others asymmetrical. You get both long and short outer lips. Labia minora also different for dia appearance and size, and e dey important to remember that when you dey compare yourself to porn stars, many of dem don do labiaplasty procedures to cosmetically change di appearance of di labia minora. Di colour of vulvar anatomy also dey completely different from one individual to another, some get light pink, others na dark brown, etc. Di vaginal canal dey one angle for your body, dis na why sometimes during kerewa or wen you dey put tampon, e go be like say you dey hit wall. Women get their own version of di condition dem dey call 'blue balls' wey na men dey normally experience am. Na discomfort for di penis and/or testicles sake of sexual frustration."

""Di way we dey do politics too gatz change. Politics need plenty money but wetin dem dey use di money do, no be to buy votes? If pipo realise say dat money dem collect dem dey sell dia future and right to good governance, tins go change.

Few hours afta Nigeria election office, Inec declare di winner, some Nigerians enta social media to share funny memes wey show di death of  wetin dem describe as 'godfatherism'. Many of di memes  dey yab  former govnor Adams Oshiomhole on top how e fail to beat Obaseki despite all im actions to frustrate am for second term. E win di election wit 307,955 votes across 18 local goment while im main opponent, di APC candidate, Osagie  Ize Iyamu get 223,619 votes. Obaseki victory no come easy sake of di plenti  political battle between him and di former govnor Adams Oshiomhole wey try everytin to make sure say im no win di election. First, e deny am to win Nigeria ruling party APC primary wey lead to oga Obaseki to port alias defect in June to di kontri main opposition PDP to contest for di 19 September election. And oga Oshiomhole also make sure e campaign against Obaseki to deny am di chance to win im second term for office. But no be Oshiomhole AKA Oshio bab only dey fight Obaseki, days to di general election, one of APC national leader, Ahmed Tinubu bin do video dey ask Edo pipo make dem no vote am. Dis two APC leaders dem bin back  Obaseki during im first term election for 2016  sake of say na oga Oshiomhole bin bring am to power. Govnor Godwin Obaseki main campaign strategy and slogan na to end godfatherism (wey mean to allow one 'powerful politician to always decide who go become what, get goment appointment or win election) for Edo State - and im message really ginger di pipo wey don tire and want to stop political leaders for di state make dem stop to impose pesin wey dem like on dem. Dis na why many Nigerians dey celebrate di election victory of Godwin Obaseki as dem don create funny memes to condem godfatherism for Nigerian politics. Politics of godfatherism don tey inside Nigeria political space and many Nigerians believe say di kontri don gradually end dis practice wit di edo election but dis one na true? Anoda state wit plenti political drama between 'godfather and a sitting govnor na Akwa-Ibom State during di 2019 election. Oga Godswill Obot Akpabio bin dey in love wit former bank executive Udom Gabriel Emmanuel and make am Secretary to the State Government (SSG). E come support am to be come govnor but before im first term go finish, dem come begin to quarrel and dem later dem come draw di battle line as di 2019 election begin draw near. Akpabio bin decamp from PDP to APC and wage war against govnor Emmanuel to remove am. But despite im political clout and how e dey popular for di state, govnor Emmanuel beat APC and win di election. Many Nigerians still remember di drama wey bin happun between  governor Aminu Tambuwal and Aliyu Wamakko Wey make am defect to di PDP to contest for di 2019 govnorship election. Di need to control di APC party and leadership structure make Tambuwal to fall out of favour wit oga Wamakko wey be ogbonge political leader for Sokoto state. Oga Tambuwal win di govnorship election afta dem do supplementary election. No wonder immediately dem declare Obaseki winner e say Obaseki victory resemble how im too take win for Sokoto state. Di case no dey different for Benue state wia  political gbege between Govnor Samuel Ortom and George Akume  bin heat up di state. Di election na really between di two political leader as each of dem try to prove who get power pass. Oga Geoarge Akume wey be former govnor of di state and di APC leader of di state na im bring Smauel Ortom for power But close to di end of im first tenure dem come di kwata as oga accuse say di former govnor no allow work sake of plenti demand. E come decamp go PDP afta e discover say oga George don make up im mind to deny am di nomination. But afta di election, and di supplementary election, dem come declare am winner. For years di PDP reign supreme for Nigeria oil rich Rivers State until one man decide to test di foundations of di party for 2015 wen e decamp go di APC. Chibuike Amaechi govern Rivers State for eight years under di umbrella of di PDP, and during dat period e rise to di level of pesin wey sabi di political game even though technically na only one election im contest and win to be govnor of di Nigerian southern state. Im porting alias defection to di APC bin look like for di first time since democracy rule for Nigeria anoda party oda dan di PDP go rule Rivers State.

Amaechi side wit Dakuku Peterside under di umbrella of di APC to rival Wike, but in di end Wike win di 2015 govnorship election and win di 2019 election again. Even though some state govnors dem don dethrone dia godfather alias pipo wey bring dem to power, Nigerians believe say di Edo case go bring total end to  godfatherism especially as di kontri prepare to elect new leaders for 2023. Although dem dey optimistic, e no clear wen dis dia dream go come through.

politics	Edo election update: Why Edo state matter to APC	"Politics na game of numbers and every state dey important to any political party. For Nigeria ruling All Progressive Congress party, di more states wey dem get to govern, di more power wey dem go fit enjoy on top different states. Until Edo state governor Godwin Obaseki bin resign from APC on June 16, 2020, di party bin dey control 21 states while opposition Peoples Democratic Party bin dey im charge of 15 states. As govnor Obaseki register as PDP member on Friday June 19, e mean say di party now get 16 states, at least till di September 19 happun. On top of dat, Edo na di only state wey APC bin fit get for South-South Nigeria afta di 2019 govornorship election for Nigeria. Lawyer and political sabi pesin Liborous Oshoma, say as long as APC remain for Edo state, e go easy for dem to get di oda south south states. ""Since 2016, APC, apart from Edo state neva fit grab any oda state for di south south and as dem wan show say dem be national party wit spread across all di geographical zones, dem go also wan win di election for Edo, dat go also fit help dem enta di oil rich Niger Delta."" If APC fail to win di govnorship election wey suppose happun on September 19, dat go mean say di party no get any power at all for di oil rich Niger Delta region. Anoda reason why APC want Edo na sake of di power struggle between di party national chairman Adams Oshiomhole and di govnor Godwin Obaseki. Oga Oshoma say, ""for Adams Oshiomhole, govnorship election for di state go be big statement for am to stamp e authority back as many pipo dey blame say im make di party lose di state to PDP."" E add say, di fact say di govnor port go PDP many pipo no happy at all as dem feel say di govnor don cari dia mandate go anoda party and dem go want am back. Plenty gbas gbos don already happun between di two inside Edo APC as di state dey prepare for election. Di gbege hot sotey e dey affect di national body of di party, and more gbege still dey road. One very strong effect of dis wahala na di fact say now di party get two acting national chairman, one wey court appoint afta e uphold Oshio Baba suspension and di oda wey di national working committee (NWC) appoint. Di two chairmen don begin dey give different order. While Victor Giadom wey court appoint say, im don cancel all decision wey Oshiomhole don make since court suspend am for March 4; Hilliard Etta wey NWC appoint say make e act as chairman to continue from wia oga Oshiomhole stop before appeal court confam im suspension on June 16. Giadom faction say dem no give instruction for di party to do primary today Monday 22 June, but Etta faction say primary must to happen today."" Lawyer Oshoma say, if dem continue to dey give counter order, e go easy for ""di court to say since una bin dey give directive and counter directive therefore e no clear for INEC to monitor wetin una dey do."" As di ruling All Progressive Congress party do dia govnorship primary today so many gbege dey ground already wey fit affect di party chance to control di state. ""If at any time di court say Giadom na di authentic acting chairman and im insist say im no go do primary witin di time of INEC guideline, e den mean say APC no get candidate. But if na otherwise den e mean say di primaries wey APC do today dey valid"" na so Oga Oshoma tok."

politics	Five lessons we learn from Ekiti govnorship election	"By Victor Ezeama Di governorship election for Ekiti state don end afta one day of voting without major wahala. Na former Secretary to di State Goverment, Biodun Oyebanji, win di low-key election. Kayode Oyebode, returning officer for di election, announce Oyebanji as governor-elect of Ekiti state early mor-mor of Sunday.\nOyebanji secure 187,057 votes to win di election. E defeat im two closest rivals — Segun Oni of Social Democratic Party (SDP) wey get 82,211 votes, and Bisi Kolawole of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) wey get 67,457 votes. ""Say Abiodun Abayomi Oyebanji of APC, having satisfied di requirements of di law, dey hereby declared  winner and returned elected,” di Inec returning officer for di election announce. Dis na di major takeaways from di election. Di election start well on Saturday 18 June as adhoc staff of di Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) arrive dia polling stations early.\nVoters also arrive dia units early to begin confam dia names for Inec list and prepare to vote. Police and security deployment also dey available to ensure say jaguda pipo no scatter di election.\nDi election start as Inec plan am by 8:30am and by 10:30am election don finish for some polling units. Wen dem swear am in Biodun Oyebanji go become di 8th govnor of Ekiti state since Nigeria return to democracy for 1999. Since di return to civilian rule, record show say no party don dey for goment back to back for Ekiti. Dis na because di state no dey experience political continuity. Becos of dis, every govnorship election for Ekiti since 1999 don produce different winners from different political parties. Although Oyebanji na different pesin from di current govnor Kayode Fayemi, dis na di first time di same political party dey retain power for di state. Im performance for office go determine if APC go remain for power afta 2026. Di Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) na di main opposition party for Ekiti state but dem carry third position for di election. According to Inec, candidate of di PDP Bisi Kolawole get 67,457 votes - behind Segun Oni of Social Democratic Party (SDP) wey get 82,211 votes. Dis one happun despite say oga Oni just join SDP three months to di election. Before di election, di PDP for di state bin get ogbonge crisis wey even di national leadership of di party no fit resolve. Di fight na between one serving Senator Abiodun Olujimi and former govnor Ayo Fayose - di two dey drag who be leader of di party for di state. Dem carry di wahala go dia primaries wey produce Bisi Kolawole wey many pipo feel say na weak candidate. Also, di fight between former Deputy govnor Kolapo Eleka and Fayose also further contribute to di division of di party. For di 18 November, 2021 governorship election for Anambra state, Inec introduce di Biomdial voter accreditation system (Bvas) for di conduct of election. Di Bvas machine na to allow voters accredit and vote at di same time. But di machine no work well for Anambra. However, Inec say di machine go remain for Nigeria election process and dem go make am good as di commission dey conduct more election. Dis na why Inec improve di functionality of di machine ahead of di Ekiti election. Dem deploy di machine wey make voting fast and easy. Complain no too dey from voters about di use of di Bvas machine. Na for dis election Inec also test wetin dem call electronic transmission of results. Unlike before wey polling officers go need to carry hard copy of result sheets go local moment for collation - now dem get transmit di result electronically to Inec and den later go submit di hard copy for verification. Dis one make di collation result for Ekiti dey very fast and easy. As at 5pm on Election Day Inec don receive results from 14 out of di 16 local government areas of di state. Di e-transmission also make am hard for pipo to alter or tamper wit results from polling units. ""See and buy"" and ""our vote no be for one pot of soup"" na di popular slang wey voters dey tok during di election on Saturday. Dis na sake of di clear cases of vote buying for majority of di polling units for di state. Vote buying na one of di most popular election offences for Nigeria. Di trend don grow over di years becos political parties bin dey hide dey do am. But dis days, dem don dey do am openly. Sadly, most voters dey also look forward to collecting money afta voting. Odas dey even show am for social media. For Ekiti, Nigeria anti corruption agency Economic and Financial crimes commission (EFCC) arrest some pipo on allegation say dem dey pay voters. Videos wey dem post for social media show wia dem parade some of di suspects wit cash and names of voters. Also, election monitoring group Yiaga Africa for dia preliminary report say dia observers ""find out several cases of vote buying during di election. ""Di vote buying dey happun for open spaces and some parties dey pay as much as N7 ,000 per vote."" Overall, Inec prepare well for di election and finish am on time but di issue of vote buying na big problem."

Dis decision later end with bad result. Afta di suqad relax in di evening, di night before - dem travel go di border. Players bin just dey laugh and joking amongst demselves for di bus. Angola security forces join dem for di border and suppose escort dem through di forest - wey be di base of one groups wey dey call for independence from Angola - to Cabinda city. Di squad no pay much attention to dia arrival.  Dem no know say very soon dem go begin fight for di lives of everyone inside di Togo team bus. Di small convoy move from di border, to di road through di forest. Looking back 10 years, midfielder Junior Senaya recall di journey, and di moment everitin change.

Di news of di attack make global headlines, and wia 24 hours earlier I bin dey able to walk in simply wit tournament accreditation, di next day heavy paramilitary security surround di hotel complex. Officials, goment ministers and representatives of di Confederation of African Football fly in from Angola capital Luanda, wit questions about wetin happen, who dey responsible, and why - for sometin wey go against tournament rules - Togo decide to drive instead of fly. Shortly afta di attack claim of responsibility comot from di Front for di Liberation of di Enclave of Cabinda, wey be separatist group wey never don accept di decision of di former colonial power, Portugal, to integrate Cabinda into Angola in di late 1950s. Several factions of di body bin dey, and which one dey responsible no dey clear - but e clear from very early on say dis no be attempted robbery. Anoda question lie for di presence Angolan security wey travel with di team. If Togo no dey authorised to drive to Cabinda, why and how come dem even get escort? And na di militarised escort cause di attack? None of dis questions get clear answers, even 10 years on - and at di time di most immediate issue for di players na to absorb wetin don happen to dem and decide wetin to do next.

In di end, Togolese authorities for Lome take decision, dem call di squad home to attend di funeral of those wey die and take part in ceremonies of national mourning - decision wey later make Caf ban dem sake of alleged ""government interference"" for football. Few days afta dia terrifying experience, Togo Sparrowhawks come out of dia hotel complex for anoda heavily armed convoy, dis time dem head towards Cabinda airport, and later leave. But di consequences of wetin happen no go easily leave di mind of those wey involve for di assault. Two pipo bin die and a number of odas seriously wound - di worst na di goalkeeper, Obilale. Initially tori spread say im die too. Dat no dey true, but e suffer serious damage to im spine, intestines, liver and bladder, and dem transfer am go hospital for South Africa, to begin e recovery.

For long time im work wit children with special needs, as e help dem through di medium of football, and e don set up e own organisation to continue dat work. Obilale lose e livelihood - and almost e life - for Cabinda and e dey striking say im tok say na since only di change in leadership for di Confederation of African Football for 2017, wen current president Ahmad comot Issa Hayatou, na im e don get any meaningful contact wit di continental governing body. On Tuesday night Caf give am special award, 10 years from Cabinda, to recognise e achievement for im recovery, and wetin e dey do to help odas. Cameroon legend Samuel Eto'o na di host for Hurghada, and e be one of several former players wey don provide steady support. Odas na e former captain Adebayor and Ghana Ayew brothers - Andre Ayew and e brother Rahim bin dey part of di Black Stars squad wey play for Cabinda for 2010. Even those wey e no affect physically face significant challenges for di wake of di attack. Junior Senaya, wey be player wey help take Togo to dia remarkable first World Cup for Germany for 2006, bin dey only 25 wen e happen, but e football career end dat day. ""E bin dey psychologically catastrophic, e turn [tins] upside down,"" na so im tok. ""I really no fit recover... I find no reason at all to play football for my club because psychologically I bin dey shocked."" Now im dey study for e coaching badges. E last for half an hour, maybe a little more. Why and how e happen na still di subject of some dispute. But no one fit deny di human cost of dat short bus trip for Cabinda, 10 years ago.
