business	Customers could get £100 for cutting energy use	"One energy supplier is predicting households could earn around £100 over the winter through a scheme to reduce peak-time energy use.
Octopus Energy said it expects to pay on average £4 each time a customer responds to a request to cut back.
National Grid will announce full details of the scheme, which can be adopted by all energy suppliers, later this month.
grid operator said some customers might get as much as £10 a day.
rsuade people to wait until later on to run their washing machine, tumble dryer, or dishwasher, and to not charge their electric car if demand is already high. 
me, set to start next month and run until March 2023, aims to help the UK avoid blackouts, by reducing energy consumption at peak times.
On Thursday National Grid warned homes could face three-hour rolling blackouts, if the UK is unable to secure enough gas and electricity imports, as demand rises over the colder months.
UK relies on gas to generate electricity, but the war in Ukraine has led to pressure on gas supplies across Europe.
Number Ten ruled out running a campaign being worked up by the business ministry to persuade households to consume less electricity.
But the National Grid is set to announce soon exactly how much it will pay per kilowatt hour for people cutting back when there is an acute shortfall in supply.
""Instead of cutting off whole chunks of the country if we are short of gas, we can reward people for using less energy at times of peak demand,"" Octopus chief executive Greg Jackson said.
k service will be available to homes that have smart meters installed, as long as their supplier is taking part in the scheme. There are about 14 million households with electricity smart meters in the UK.
Octopus Energy, which ran a trial of the scheme earlier this year, said there could be 25 days over the next six months when National Grid was willing to pay households to reduce their use.
Julie Byrne in Saffron Walden embraced the Octopus trial with gusto. She switched off lights, hung the towels outdoors to dry, turned the computer off, and even postponed dinner, despite her 25-year-old son rolling his eyes.
""Sometimes it was inconvenient,"" she says. ""But we worked round it.""
Her smart meter is outdoors so Julie didn't check which of her cut-backs was saving more, but she did see a small reduction in her next bill.
""It wasn't just the money. I felt I was helping,"" she said, though with the cost of living rising, she thinks, the payments are ""always going to be a plus.""
Customers who managed to cut back compared to their recent average electricity consumption would be rewarded with a payment, likely to be between £3 and £6 per kilowatt hour saved, Octopus said. 
mpensation rate was likely to be set higher on days when the energy shortfall was particularly severe, the firm said.
During Octopus' trial in February and March customers saved an average of 0.7 kilowatt hours, but were receiving much lower financial compensation, the firm said.
Under the National Grid-backed scheme, customers, including businesses, will receive an email or text a day ahead, outlining the time slot when they would be paid if they reduce their energy use, usually between 4pm and 7pm.
Mr Jackson believes the financial incentive, which is significantly higher than it was in the trial, will prove effective, noting that people regularly change their habits to make savings - even small ones.
""If you go to the supermarket and you buy stuff that's reduced to clear, you're saving less than a pound. People respond to that,"" said Mr Jackson. 
He believes there will be savings for the country as a whole as well. ""Today our system pays a fortune to have diesel and coal generation on standby.
""Every unit of energy that is saved will save on expensive standby diesel and coal.""

business	Energy bills: 'We cut back but are paying three times as much'	"Amy Appleyard had been paying £136 a month to heat and light her home.
Knowing that energy bills would rise in the autumn, she and her family had cut back on how much power they were using.
But they were shocked to be told that their monthly direct debit would rise more than three times to £442.
re just one of many UK households who have cut back on energy but are still being charged higher direct debits. But suppliers say bills have to reflect soaring energy prices.
It comes after Business Secretary Grant Shapps wrote to energy firms asking them to ensure bills reflected the amount of energy customers were using, and not to over-estimate charges. 
Mrs Appleyard, her husband Mike and eight-year-old daughter Kathryn, faced the huge hike in direct debit energy payments despite cutting back at their three-bedroom home in Greater Manchester.
""We've all become a bit more obsessive about turning off lights or unplugging chargers,"" Mrs Appleyard said.
""We also didn't put the heating on as early as usual this year, just maybe for an hour to warm the house through.""
She said her family's ""nightmare"" started because her supplier cut their monthly direct debit without telling them, so when it made its annual review of their monthly payments it led to a much bigger increase than usual.
""After spending hours on the phone, and being guaranteed that I would pay £200 monthly, and then seeing that £442 was still taking out of my account, I just burst into tears,"" she said.
Since then there have been more conversations and Mrs Appleyard said she hoped the situation will soon be sorted.
""We just want to pay for the gas and electricity we used but it's become very difficult,"" she said.
""I've been told that only £200 will be taken out of my account in December, but the situation is ongoing and has been horribly stressful.""
Meanwhile, Rory in South Wales said his direct debits had also gone up, while his energy use had gone down, so he ended up £1,400 in credit with his supplier.
He told Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show that he had asked to reduce his direct debit to a monthly amount he could afford but his supplier refused.
He said the direct debits have been increased to £481 even though his monthly usage has been nearer £300.
""I simply want to reduce it to an amount I can afford to pay and use the surplus to top up. I don't want to have all that money sitting there and me paying a ridiculous amount to the energy provider,"" he said.
Customers who pay gas and electricity bills by direct debit have the costs evened out over the year in a process known as smoothing.
m of smoothing is to avoid sudden bill shocks by spreading the cost over the whole year so even if you use a lot more energy in a winter month, you don't get a nasty surprise.
u get should be the actual amount you're charged for your energy. It is a combination of a standing daily charge plus your metered energy usage (your unit rate per kWh). 
It will change every month, depending on how much energy you use.
Suppliers encourage direct debit payments by offering customers a discount. They then estimate what your bills will be over the year, based on the price of gas and electricity and on your previous and predicted energy use.
Suppliers should ensure your direct debit payment is fair and proportionate to your usage.
If any customer ends up overpaying, they should be able to claim the extra amount back at the end of the year and maybe reduce their direct debits.
However rising energy costs - prices have doubled since last year - have left most people facing higher direct debits.
If your direct debit payments are regularly higher than your bills, you can challenge the amount with your supplier. 
Ask them to lower your monthly payments to reflect more accurately the amount of energy you actually use, based on your meter readings.
If they refuse you can make a complaint to your supplier and if you get no satisfaction you can escalate it to the Energy Ombudsman. 
Earlier this year, an Ofgem review of how energy firms were charging customers by direct debit revealed that about 500,000 households had seen their payments double, despite prices rising by 54%.
It told UK energy suppliers to review the way they charge customers by direct debit.
Ofgem said it had already called on firms to address the issue, but would be prepared to take further action if necessary.
At the weekend Mr Shapps told energy firms: ""I am interested to understand how you intend to ensure that your direct debit system does not over-estimate charging.""
Energy UK, the industry trade body, has said rising direct debits were inevitable as bills had to reflect the doubling in energy prices since last year.
Household energy costs are set to rise again next year which will mean further rises in direct debits.
government's energy price guarantee is being scaled back from April, when a typical household's annual bill will increase to £3,000."
business	Crown Resorts: Casino firm fined over illegal China dealings	"Australian gaming operator Crown Resorts has been fined A$80m ($57.4m; £45.6m) for illegally accepting Chinese bank cards at its casino in Melbourne.
Regulators say the transactions were falsely classified as hotel services.
r money laundering and excessive gambling casinos in Australia are not allowed to accept bank cards.
Crown acknowledged its ""historic failings"" and says its top executives were in the process of reforming how the company operates.
On Monday, the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission (VGCCC) said Crown had breached Australia's casino regulations by allowing gambling funds to be withdrawn using credit or debit cards.
regulator found that Crown had processed A$164m Australian dollars in China UnionPay card payments, drawing in A$32m of revenue in the process, between 2012 and 2016.
It said the transactions were falsely classified as ""services"" provided by the Crown Towers hotel in Melbourne.
However, patrons were given vouchers that could be exchanged for cash or chips at Crown's neighbouring casino.
According to the regulator, the ""clandestine"" scheme also allowed some Chinese nationals to spend more in foreign currencies than was allowed under Chinese law.
""Crown benefited handsomely from its illegal conduct,"" VGCCC chairwoman Fran Thorn said in a statement.
""The fine will ensure that Crown is stripped of the revenue it derived from the process and will send a clear message that it must comply with its regulatory obligations,"" Ms Thorn added.
In response, the gaming group said its board and senior management were ""committed to the delivery of a comprehensive reform and remediation programme to ensure Crown delivers a safe and responsible gaming environment"".
Crown - which operates integrated resorts in Melbourne, Perth and Sydney - is also under scrutiny from regulators who have alleged the company had knowingly dealt with criminal organisations then misled authorities about those dealings.
Its casino in Melbourne is currently only allowed to operate under the supervision of a government-appointed manager.

business	Energy bills: More help may be expected next year, says think tank	"government is likely to come under pressure to help households with soaring energy bills again next year, the Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank has warned.
IFS said calls for help were likely to continue for ""at least"" another year if oil and gas prices do not fall.
Energy bills are expected to keep rising until at least spring 2023.
But the government insisted the support package announced by the chancellor on Thursday was a ""temporary"" measure.
£15bn package means every UK household will get an energy bill discount of £400 from October, with further support for the poorest households, pensioners and disabled people.
w measures add to around £17bn of support already given by the government. This included one-off £150 council tax rebates for most homes in England and Wales and matched funding for the other devolved nations.
A steep rise in the cost of living, in particular a jump in energy prices in April, and a second one scheduled for October, had put growing pressure on the government to take action.
uncement, which came a day after the publication of Sue Gray's report into rule-breaking at Downing Street during the pandemic, was on a larger scale than many expected.
upport was broadly welcomed and described as a ""genuinely big package"" by the IFS. 
However, the think tank warned that it could prompt calls for additional support again next year, which in turn could contribute to further inflation.
""I think the biggest risk is that the chancellor will be tempted to do this again and again, and I think if that happens then we really could be in for a bit of trouble,"" IFS director Paul Johnson told the BBC's Today programme.
""He's got the most extraordinarily difficult decisions to make later this year on public sector pay, and then he'll be under pressure I suspect again this time next year when energy prices will still be high. 
""I think if he's tempted to continue putting money in to an economy where inflation is very high then that becomes a significant risk.""
Adam Scorer, chief executive of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, said the chancellor's measures averted ""the darkest of outcomes"" but warned ""millions will still be struggling and the energy crisis is far from over"".
He said a ""large, more targeted intervention is what was needed ahead of winter"", and said the government needed to plan for energy prices to remain high for some time. 
f living is set to continue to rise, with inflation - the rate at which prices go up - at a 40-year high and forecast to hit 10% later this year. 
Concerns have also been raised that the extra support for households could contribute to further inflation, by providing more spending power in the economy at a time when supply chains and the labour market are struggling to meet demand.
However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak insisted that his new measures would have a ""minimal impact"" on inflation.
Higher energy prices, caused in part by the war in Ukraine, have been a key factor driving inflation and analysts expect energy costs to remain high.
Cornwall Insight, has predicted the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, will be marginally higher in spring 2023 to around £2,818 than the price cap this autumn at £2,791. 
f the extra support for energy bills will be partly offset by a 25% additional tax on oil and gas firms' profits, which have soared in recent months.
Opposition parties had been calling for a windfall tax on energy firms for several months. 
A windfall tax is a one-off levy imposed by a government on a company. The idea is to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall.
Mr Sunak said the ""energy profits levy"" had been designed so it would ""incentivise and encourage investment"".
But Dan Atzori, research partner at Cornwall Insight, warned the tax came with ""risks to both investment and energy security"".
If windfall taxes were repeated over time, Mr Atzori said, it risked ""creating an unstable environment, and may lead to energy producers, who operate globally, investing and relocating to other areas"".
government had previously rejected the idea of a windfall tax on energy firms' profit, but Mr Sunak said with the sector ""making extraordinary profits"" he was ""sympathetic to the argument to tax those profits fairly"".
However, energy giant BP said while it knew ""how difficult things are for people"" Thursday's announcement was ""not for a one-off tax"" but a ""multi-year proposal"".
""Naturally we will now need to look at the impact of both the new levy and the tax relief on our North Sea investment plans,"" it said.
which represents oil and gas firms, Offshore Energies UK, said the levy would ""drive away"" investors and cut UK energy production."
business	UK faces worst downturn of any advanced economy, OECD says	"UK economy will suffer a bigger blow from the global energy crisis than other leading nations, according to international body the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
UK will contract by more than any other nation in the G7 group next year, it said.
Growth in the US and the eurozone will be weak, but Germany is the only other major economy expected to shrink.
OECD forecasts a ""significant growth slowdown"" globally in 2023.
ks to the strength of emerging economies, the world economy will grow by 2.2% next year, the OECD's latest report predicts.
But the war in Ukraine was affecting economies unevenly, the OECD said, with European countries bearing the brunt of the impact on business, trade and the spike in energy prices. 
G7 includes the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. While growth is expected to be weaker in most countries in the group, only Germany and the UK will contract, the OECD predicts.
OECD expects the UK's economyto shrink by 0.4% in 2023 to be followed by shallow growth of just 0.2% in 2024.
By contrast, last week the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted the UK would shrink by 1.4% next year, although it also predicted stronger growth, of 1.3% in 2024. The OBR said that would lead to the biggest drop in living standards on record.
Earlier this month the Bank of England predicted the downturn could last for two years.
Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to fall by 0.3%, the OECD report says.
Of the wider group of G20 countries, only Russia, which is subject to economic sanctions, is predicted to fare worse than the UK.
OECD, an intergovernmental body that focuses on economic policy, lays some of the blame for the UK's poor performance on the Energy Price Guarantee, the scheme to support household and business energy bills.
While subsidising energy bills reduces the immediate headline inflation rate, the OECD warns that it will add to overall demand in the economy, increasing inflationary pressures in the medium-term. That in turn would require the Bank of England to raise interest rates further and add to the cost of servicing debts.
""Better targeting of measures to cushion the impact of high energy prices would lower the budgetary cost, better-preserve incentives to save energy, and reduce the pressure on demand at a time of high inflation,"" it said.
UK government is moving away from universal support for energy bills after this winter, the prime minister's spokesman pointed out. 
""We're taking a different approach post-April to the energy support, targeting it towards the most vulnerable,"" he said.
In response to the OECD's forecast for the economy, he said this year the UK was forecast to be the fastest growing economy in the G7.
""These are challenges that are affecting different countries at slightly different times,"" he said. 
""We emerged from the pandemic faster than many other countries in Europe. But some of these challenges are shared,"" he said. 
Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said: ""We are forecast to be the only OECD economy that will be smaller in 2024 than it was in 2019.
""This is the Tory doom loop. A low growth spiral leading to higher taxes, lower investment, squeezed wages and poor public services.""
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney described the OECD forecast as a ""damning verdict"" and said a succession of Conservative chancellors this year had wrecked hope of growth.
OECD said UK inflation - which hit a 41-year high of 11.1% in October - is likely to peak at the end of this year but remain above 9% in early 2023, slowing to 4.5% by the end of next year.
rganisation expects UK interest rates to rise from their current level of 3% to 4.5% next April and unemployment to rise to 5% by the end of 2024. 
f paying for help with energy bills showed up on the government's accounts in October, as households began receiving the first tranche of a £400 subsidy, and the lower £2,500 energy price cap came into effect.
Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that these schemes together cost £3.4bn in October.
ushed up government borrowing - the difference between government spending and tax income - to £13.5bn last month, the ONS said.
Although the figure was £4.4bn higher than last year it was lower than analysts had expected.
ONS said that borrowing in the financial year to date - covering April to October 2022 - was £84.4bn, although this was £21.7bn less than in the same period last year."
business	Royal Mail staff call off planned strike action	"Planned strikes by Royal Mail workers in the next two weeks have been called off after a challenge by the firm.
Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) are involved in a dispute over pay and conditions.
CWU said it had decided to withdraw industrial action notices for the next fortnight following a legal letter from Royal Mail.
A series of strikes have taken place in recent weeks and action will now resume on Saturday 12 November.
CWU general secretary Dave Ward said: ""We recognise the deep frustration felt by many members over this decision.""
rike action involves more than 115,000 workers, the union said.
CWU has been locked in a long-running dispute with the company around pay increases keeping up with the soaring cost of living and working practices.
median pay at Royal Mail is £32,465 a year, with the average pay for a postal delivery worker lower than that at £25,777. 
Royal Mail has blamed strike action for rising losses and job cuts, as well as lower volumes of parcels being posted.
""The fact remains that the current direction of Royal Mail doesn't benefit the company, the community or the country,"" Mr Ward added.
""We still need to secure a decent future of this industry, and no attempts to attack our union and our members will change our determination in fighting for that.""
Royal Mail confirmed that the CWU had withdrawn planned strike action originally planned for 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10 November.
""The CWU has withdrawn strike action following Royal Mail writing to CWU to highlight numerous material concerns with the formal notification of planned rolling strike action,"" a spokesperson said.
mpany and the CWU are due to attend scheduled talks at the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) on Monday.
""We will continue to do all we can to keep business, companies and the country connected,"" the Royal Mail spokesperson added.
Royal Mail said strike action cost the business £70m during the first half of its financial year, leading to an operating loss of £219m, compared to a £235m profit last year.
It has been attempting to make the company a ""parcels-led"" business as the number of letters being sent through the post declines and more people shop online."

""The executives of companies that operate such plants also have a huge responsibility on them that is incomparable with other companies.""

Fukushima nuclear disaster happened on 11 March 2011 when a massive earthquake off north-east Japan triggered a tsunami which led to a nuclear meltdown.
It was the worst nuclear power incident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, but has been considered less damaging to local people because far lower quantities of radioactive iodine were released.
No one was killed in the disaster, but the long-term effects of the radiation remain a matter of debate.

rease is pencilled in for April 2023, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).
Fuel duty is a tax motorists pay when buying fuels such as petrol and diesel.
It could go up by 23% in April, according to the OBR, which provides independent checks of the government's economic plans.
would be ""the largest rise in the fuel duty rate in history"", it said.
12p per litre rise across petrol and diesel prices would be expected to bring in about £5.7bn in extra taxes.
We don't know yet. 
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the government has not made a decision to hike fuel duty.
He said that ""is not government policy"" and that the Treasury would ""make a decision on that at the next Budget in the spring"".
Speaking after the fuel duty rise was included in the OBR's review of the government's Autumn Statement, he said: ""That was just an assumption that the OBR made.""
So, it is still possible the duty could be frozen or go up by a different amount.
In theory, fuel duty should go up every year.
However, in March, Rishi Sunak - who was chancellor at the time - used the government's Spring Statement to cut the tax, following concerns about rising prices.
Fuel duty on petrol and diesel was reduced by 5p, from 58p to 53p, for 12 months.
OBR's statement assumes that 5p cut will end as planned in March.
It has also factored in a scheduled rise of 7p on top of that.
However, chancellors do not always go ahead with increases to fuel duty.
Before Mr Sunak reduced it, the tax had been frozen since 2011.
Fuel duty goes into the government's general spending pot.
And it's a big money-spinner, tending to raise about £28bn a year.
reasury said the 5p cut introduced in March would cost the public purse £2.4bn in 2022/23.
For 2022-23, the OBR expects fuel duties to raise £26.2bn in total.
re's also a question mark over how the government will make up the shortfall in the tax as more people start to drive electric cars.
However, the Treasury will also start charging vehicle excise duty on them from 2025.
Petrol and diesel prices have been on a rollercoaster ride this year.
Recent data puts petrol at an average of 164p per litre on UK forecourts. 
's a few pennies below the level it was at the Spring Statement when fuel duty was cut.
A wide gap has opened up between petrol and diesel, which is now at an average of 188p - about 8p higher than in March. 
After the fuel duty cut in March, prices came down a bit - only to shoot up to record highs in the summer.

Fuel prices in the UK move together with changes in the price of crude oil - which it is made from.
re also affected by the exchange rate between the pound and dollar, as crude oil is traded in dollars. A weaker pound means fuel gets more expensive.
Prices were rising before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the fallout made fuel more expensive.

US has banned all imports of Russian oil. The UK is phasing it out, and EU sanctions will block most Russian oil imports after 5 December."

""Fast-rising rents are not offering any relief and could keep some buyers in the hunt for a home for longer than they would like,"" said Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor,
""Even though the housing market is slowing, it is nowhere near a crash. Strong demand for homes far outstripping available housing inventory means the housing market remains a difficult one for wannabe homeowners and those looking to climb up the property ladder.""
Nationwide is predicting that an increase in energy costs and rising mortgage interest rates will add to the pressure on household budgets in the coming months.
It suggested that the least energy efficient property could typically see bills surge by £2,700 a year, or £225 a month.
""There are signs that the housing market is losing some momentum,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist.
""We expect the market to slow further as pressure on household budgets intensifies in the coming quarters, with inflation set remain in double digits into next year.

mpany said it remained ""focused on taking care of our Russian-based associates"" and had been supporting individuals in Ukraine and Russia to secure employment with Marriott outside countries affected by the conflict. 
""We continue to join our associates and millions of people around the world in wishing for an end to the current violence and the start of a path towards peace,"" it added. 
Marriott joins McDonald's, Starbucks and other companies in heading for the exits in recent weeks as the war in Ukraine continues and Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically tighten.
Public outcry over Vladimir Putin's invasion also put pressure on Western brands to distance themselves. Hotel brands drew attention for being among the slowest to respond.
""The process to suspend operations in a market where Marriott has operated for 25 years is complex,"" the company said in a statement.
Marriott did not provide further details about its exit.

business	Argentina rate hiked to 69.5% as inflation hits 20-year high	"Argentina's central bank has raised its main rate of interest to 69.5% as it tries to contain soaring inflation.
k put up its 28-day benchmark rate by 9.5% percentage points, its second hike in as many weeks.
It comes as new figures showed inflation in the country had hit a 20-year high of over 70%.
umbers dashed hopes that price rises had peaked after the latest US data showed that inflation had eased.
""The rise in the policy rate will help reduce inflation expectations for the remainder of the year,"" the bank said in a statement.
move came after the bank raised the rate by 8 percentage points two weeks ago and marks its eighth hike this year.
untry's inflation rate is forecast to top 90% by the end of the year.
Controlling soaring prices, tackling high debt levels and reining in government spending in South America's second largest economy are at the top of the agenda for Argentina's latest economy minister, Sergio Massa.
Mr Massa, who is the third person to hold the post since early last month, aims to calm inflation using a more conventional approach than his predecessors.
Along with raising interest rates, he has pledged to not call on the central bank to print more money this year to fund government spending.
In July, Martín Guzmán resigned as finance minister after being in the role for more than two and a half years. His successor Silvina Batakis lasted just a month in the post.
Earlier this year, Argentina avoided defaulting on a $44bn International Monetary Fund loan.
However, the impact of measures the government has to implement to meet the conditions of the deal is a major cause of concern for many in the country.
In recent weeks, protestors have taken to the streets of the capital Buenos Aires to demonstrate against President Alberto Fernández' handling of the economy.

business	Energy firms must offer more help on bill payments, Ofgem warns	"Most of the UK's energy suppliers must improve how they help people who are struggling to pay their bills, watchdog Ofgem has said. 
Its review found failures in firms being able to identify which customers were having payment difficulties and a lack of help with payment plans.
government has stepped in to cap a typical household energy bill at £2,500 a year until 2024 but this is still unaffordable for many customers.
rise comes in on 1 October.
Campaigners have warned millions of people will still face fuel poverty this winter, despite Prime Minister Liz Truss' multi-billion pound plan to ease the impact of higher gas and electricity bills.
A household is considered to be in fuel poverty if it has to spend 10% or more of its income on energy.
If you are struggling to afford your gas and electricity bills, Citizens Advice recommends contacting your supplier directly and offering to come up with a payment plan.
Energy suppliers must offer payment plans that customers can afford, under Ofgem rules. In addition, those on pre-payment meters who do not have the money to top them up can ask for emergency credit.
Citizens Advice said that by the end of August its frontline staff had supported more than 15,000 people who were unable to top up their prepayment meter.
rity's chief executive, Dame Clare Moriarty, said Ofgem's review showed some energy companies were ""falling drastically short of the mark"". 
""This is utterly unacceptable given the huge cost-of-living pressures people are facing,"" she said. ""Suppliers need to up their game and Ofgem needs to hold them to task.""
Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said its review found some suppliers had fallen short of the standards expected by the watchdog and urged them to ""step up"".
""Although the government's package of support will provide some welcome relief, it's critical that, going into this tough winter, energy companies prioritise the needs of vulnerable customers struggling to pay their bills,"" he said.

All the energy companies identified have been asked to submit information to Ofgem to set out how they will improve their service.
Ofgem said it had already issued provisional orders to Utilita and ScottishPower, meaning they must take specific and urgent actions.
A ScottishPower spokesperson said: ""We're disappointed that all of the effort our staff make to help our customers manage affordability challenges has resulted in this conclusion from Ofgem.
""We will now work with Ofgem to implement their recommendations.""
A Utilita spokesperson said the company was ""very disappointed"" about Ofgem's ""decision to issue a provisional order rather than to engage with us"". 
""Our staff are deeply committed to helping customers through the cost-of-living crisis and the financial support we offer is extensive: In 2022 alone, we will provide financial assistance more than a million times to customers who need our help,"" it added."
business	Pulsic takeover by Super Orange HK blocked on security grounds	"UK has blocked the takeover of an electronic design company by a Hong Kong firm because of concerns over risks to national security.
Super Orange HK had sought to acquire Bristol-based Pulsic. 
But the government said there was the potential for tools to be exploited ""to build defence or technological capabilities"". 
Chinese embassy said the UK should provide a fair and ""non-discriminatory environment"" for Chinese businesses. 
move is the latest attempt to limit Chinese involvement in British businesses and technology. 
In 2020, Chinese mobile provider Huawei was banned from the UK's 5G infrastructure over national security concerns, which were denied by the company. 
government is also reviewing a Chinese-backed takeover of Newport Wafer Fab, Britain's largest microchip factory. 
keover attempt was blocked under the National Security and Investment Act, which came into force in January. 
It gives the government powers to scrutinise and intervene in business transactions to protect national security.
Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the software developed by Pulsic could be used ""to facilitate the building of cutting-edge integrated circuits that could be used in a civilian or military supply chain"". 
It said the decision to block the takeover was ""necessary and proportionate to mitigate the risk to national security"". 
Chinese embassy in the UK said: ""Any abuse of national security review will only damage the UK's investment environment and long-term interests.""
Pulsic, which has offices in Bristol, Newcastle, Tokyo and San Jose, has not yet responded to a request for comment. 
Super Orange HK could not be reached for comment. The Chinese Embassy in the UK has been contacted for comment. 
Conservative leadership favourite Liz Truss has said Beijing's ""increasing assertiveness"" is a ""deep security concern"". 
""We should look at making sure we're not exporting technology that can be used against us. We need to clear investment screening and we've developed that to make sure that we can't have acquisitions of key strategic assets,"" the foreign secretary told a leadership hustings on Wednesday. 
She has also said the UK should be cracking down on Chinese-owned companies such as social media platform TikTok. "
business	Cost of living: Lessons from history about how we spend	"In 1967, in a field near the village of Cridling Stubbs in North Yorkshire, a pot containing more than 3,300 Roman coins was unearthed.
rd of copper coins from the 300s AD were still in the jar, buried upright, with a makeshift lid on top.
""We do not know for certain why they were buried there, and why nobody ever came back to find them,"" says Kat Baxter, Leeds Museums and Galleries' curator of archaeology and numismatics.
""That is the beauty of them - we do not know the answers. It is very mysterious.""
We may not have the answers, but there are theories. The coins not only help us think about what wealthy people were doing with their cash nearly 2,000 years ago but may also frame some of the debate about the cost of living and cash today.
Cridling Stubbs hoard may have been buried for religious reasons, as some kind of offering to the gods. 
Another possibility, is that it was hidden somewhere thought to be safe in a time before banks and building societies, particularly if the owners felt their money might be taken during a time of conflict.
""These were the security worries of the time. We have the same worries today but they just take a different form,"" Ms Baxter says.
Fraudsters steal £4m a day from people in the UK, so protection against such cons is high on the agenda for the finance industry and its customers.
Cridling Stubbs hoard is among more than 400 objects on display at the Money Talks exhibition, which runs at Leeds City Museum until 26 June.
As well as money security, the exhibits explore subjects including how money has been used in toys and play, the evolution of banking, and different examples of currency used around the world.
""Everyone has a relationship with money in some way,"" Ms Baxter says.
Our relationship with money is being tested at present, not only through the rising cost of living, but also in the changing way we pay for things.
Since 2015, according to the consumer group Which?, some 4,685 bank branches have shut their doors.
A further 226 are already scheduled to close by the end of the year, it says, while the rate of closures in rural areas has outstripped those in urban areas.
People are increasingly using their smartphones and computers to manage their finances. Cards are now a much more common method of transaction than notes and coins.
However, Which? has warned that a move to a cashless society would leave millions of people ""cut adrift"". The government declared in the most recent Queen's Speech that it would legislate to ensure people had access to cash withdrawal and deposit facilities within a reasonable distance of home.
xhibition in Leeds confirms there are plenty of examples through history of changing ways of paying for things.
ke, for example, the kind of items used as currency. In one display case sits a finely polished and ground axe head. It was probably never used to chop anything, but would have been used in some kind of transaction - a bit like bartering.
Ms Baxter points out that there would be a wider cultural impact if notes and coins were to disappear entirely.
One part of the exhibition examines how cash is used as a lucky charm in many ways - from popping it into the shoe of a new bride, to embedding it into necklaces.
""Going cashless does not just mean losing physical coins, it means losing a number of traditions too,"" she says.
Less of a charm and more of a convenience is the way payment is often embedded into the things we wear and carry nowadays.
Using a smartphone or a watch, many of us will routinely tap to pay for items, or a bus or train fare, 
Perhaps we are happy to lose some of the traditions and physicality of cash?
A recent survey by the card issuing platform, Marqeta, found that 77% of respondents aged 18 to 24 were confident enough in contactless payments to leave their wallet at home and go out with just their phone.
""While the pandemic was the catalyst for the shift to contactless and mobile wallets, it is the convenience, security, and speed of these payment options that have made them sticky,"" says Anna Porra, Marqeta's European strategy director.
Although she says these so-called intelligent mobile wallets are still in their infancy.
Diners are already paying at a restaurant by scanning a QR code on their phone at the table and settling the bill, without ever having to call over a waiter. Soon, she says, we will be standing at a bus stop and scanning QR codes for something we might be able to buy nearby.
most significant developments will come, she suggests, when our devices not only act as a payment mechanism but also use artificial intelligence to prompt us with ways to manage our finances.
merging of payments and financial services could even give information to businesses of our worthiness to buy something on credit, and guide consumers on the way to pay and whether it is affordable.
So-called super apps in the US and China already branch out into identifying what financial products might be available to consumers, as well as providing other services such as food, hotels and taxi options.
Ms Porra says widespread adoption of intelligent wallets will only come if providers also offer widespread education, to ensure users can be confident and have control over what is being suggested.
So, in the end it comes back to trust and security - not so different to the thought processes of someone burying a pot of coins in North Yorkshire nearly 2,000 years ago."
business	Business energy prices to be cut by half expected levels	"Energy bills for UK businesses will be cut by around half their expected level this winter under a huge government support package.
me will fix wholesale gas and electricity prices for firms for six months from 1 October, shielding businesses from crippling costs.
Hospitals, schools and charities will also get help, the government said.
It comes after ministers announced a multi-billion pound plan to help households with bills for two years.
Analysts suggest the help for firms and households combined could cost up to £150bn.
Industry groups welcomed the package but warned further support may be needed after the winter.
It is understood the scheme will be reviewed after three months with an option to extend support for ""vulnerable businesses"" - but it is not known what sectors come under the category.
Wholesale prices, which are what suppliers pay for energy in bulk before they distribute it to customers, are expected to be fixed for all non-domestic energy customers at £211 per MWh for electricity and £75 per MWh for gas. 
rates will be the base cost, to which other add-ons, such as standing charges will be added by suppliers.
Independent analysts Cornwall Insight said the plan marked a ""substantial"" 45% discount on wholesale energy prices at the end of last week. 
government said the scheme would apply to companies which had agreed fixed deals at higher prices on or after 1 April, when energy bills started to surge. Those on variable and flexible tariffs will also be eligible.
Companies do not need to contact suppliers as the discount will automatically be applied to their bills, with savings seen from October but received from November.
Josh Farrant, manager at The Ye Olde Fleece Inn in Kendal, Cumbria, said the pub was facing a hike in energy bills from £44,000 to around £124,000 a year before the government's wholesale cap was announced.
""That some help is coming gives us a bit of hope,"" he said. ""But we are still massively going to have to look at the way we do things.""
""It doesn't mean the panic is over. It's going to run for six months, then we'll see.""
Guy Adams, who runs the Isle of Barra Beach Hotel in the Hebrides, said he had been quoted a 377% increase in his energy bills before the cap, which ""would probably have finished us off"".
""At present our cheapest room rate is £110 per night. We would have had to raise that to £415 per night,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.
However, he said because his seasonal hotel will close for the winter and reopen in May, it was ""absolutely impossible"" to set prices for bookings given the support package will only run until April.
""The fact that it is going to be reviewed in six months is not practical,"" he added.
Prime Minister Liz Truss said the government understood the ""huge pressure"" businesses, charities and public sector organisations faced with bills. She added that the new scheme would provide ""certainty and peace of mind"".
Bur Labour business spokesman Jonathan Reynolds said there were still questions about ""how much this will cost and who will pay for it"".
Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said the ""delayed announcement"" left businesses ""under a cloud of damaging uncertainty"". 
""The government have no plan beyond these next six months, paralysing businesses who need to make decisions for the long term,"" she added.
upport will apply to all non-domestic energy customers in England, Scotland and Wales. A scheme offering comparable support will be established in Northern Ireland.
Officials have not said how much the package will cost the taxpayer, but Cornwall Insight estimates it at around £25bn. 
Energy-intensive industries, such as steel-making, have warned that businesses could go bust due to their energy costs, which have surged since Russia invaded Ukraine.
Unlike households, businesses are not covered by an energy price cap, which is the maximum amount a supplier can charge per unit of energy. It means non-domestic bills have soared even higher.
government announced earlier this month that bills for a typical household would be limited to £2,500 annually until 2024 under a separate scheme.
On Wednesday, it also said:
g problem with this support for business is its shelf life. Few businesses plan with only a six-month time horizon and there will be some whose plans to cut production, close premises and let staff go will not change as a result of this intervention.  
But many others - particularly those in retail and hospitality - may see this giving them a fighting chance over the commercially crucial Christmas trading period.
government has thrown an emergency blanket over the economy this winter, but longer term, more fundamental reform to the energy supply market, its pricing and mechanics will be needed.
Developing more cheap renewables, securing foreign supplies of liquid gas, drilling for more domestic fossil fuels, breaking the link between gas prices and electricity and pushing ahead with hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and small and large scale nuclear have been part of the government's plan for nearly two years. 
What's new is the pressure applied by Vladimir Putin to do it as fast as possible. 
Stephen Phipson of Make UK, which represents manufacturers, said businesses would ""warmly welcome"" the government support package.
""Government has delivered a scheme which is simple to understand, giving reassurance to the business sector and making immediately available the much-needed help companies have been calling for across the board.""
However, he warned that energy prices were likely to remain high for more than six months and firms may need ""support for a longer period if we are to protect jobs and remain competitive"". 
Director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said the price cap would give steelmakers ""the chance to get through the winter"". But he called on the government to ""rapidly reform the energy market to ensure longer-term competitive prices"".
Smaller businesses have also been struggling with rising bills, with brewery bosses warning that pubs and restaurants could be forced to close after energy costs soared by as much as 300%.
A landlord of one Essex pub told the BBC his energy bill had risen from about £13,000 a year to £35,000.
Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said the industry was ""relieved"" by the support ahead of the busy Christmas trading period, adding it would secure jobs.
What questions do you have about the new support package for businesses?"
business	Mortgage rates rise sharply as squeeze tightens	"Major mortgage lenders are increasing the cost of home loans, with the average two-year fixed rate now close to 6%, new figures show.
A typical two-year fixed mortgage deal is currently 5.75%, up from 4.74% on the day of the mini-budget, financial information service Moneyfacts said.
Lenders have been scrambling to reprice deals after the pound's fall fuelled forecasts of higher interest rates.
Mortgage rates have climbed since December as interest rates have risen.
In December, the average two-year fixed deal was 2.34%.
Fixed deal interest rates do not change during the term of the mortgage, so rates are quoted for new or renewing borrowers.
Lenders have also withdrawn hundreds of products in recent days, which may leave some borrowers with difficulties securing a deal. 
recently re-priced deals have tended to be from major lenders who want relatively low-risk borrowers. Those homeowners who have high debt levels, or who may have missed repayments on credit, may find their choice is much more limited in the short-term.
Brokers say there is still money available for mortgage providers to lend, but the days of ultra-low rates - typical of the last decade - have quickly disappeared.
""We did not expect that to happen quite so rapidly,"" one broker said.
Mortgage rates have been rising ever since the Bank of England began a series of seven consecutive rises in the Bank rate - the benchmark figure of interest rates. Rates then jumped after the mini-budget prompted widespread expectation of a faster and higher jump in the Bank rate in the coming months.
Lenders look at the long-term cost of borrowing, and potential demand, and try to stay a step ahead of the Bank of England when setting the rates for fixed rate deals.
Roughly 100,000 people a month come to the end of a fixed deal and often remortgage, while first-time buyers also sign up to fixed deals. The 1.5 million homeowners on variable or tracker deals often see their costs rise in direct response to a Bank rate rise.
A typical five-year fixed deal has been slightly cheaper than a two-year fixed deal for some time - but both are now seeing rates rise sharply.
""The normal rules of lending have changed,"" said Aaron Strutt of Trinity Financial.
Halifax - the UK's biggest mortgage lender - said it would launch its new, higher rates on Wednesday. 
""The new rates reflect the continued increase in mortgage market pricing over recent weeks,"" a spokesperson for Halifax said.
In recent days, other major lenders such as NatWest, Nationwide and Virgin Money have increased their rates.
NatWest did so on Sunday, a highly unusual day of the week to make a change, according to brokers, signalling the speed at which the market is changing.
A homeowner borrowing £200,000 on a 30-year mortgage may have been looking at a rate of 3.5% and a monthly repayment of £898 just over a week ago. Now, there are more likely to be facing a 5.5% rate and a monthly repayment of £1,135.
As always, there is uncertainty over the longer-term trend for mortgage rates. People will have to consider how much they can borrow, and what lenders will judge them to be able to afford.
Amid the turmoil of last week, lenders pulled deals off the shelf at unprecedented levels, with brokers saying deals were lasting for a very short period of time as people flooded them and lenders with enquiries.
Moneyfacts said that there were 3,961 deals available on the morning of the mini-budget, compared with 2,262 at the start of this week - a 43% fall. Products were last withdrawn quickly at the start of the pandemic, but not at such a level.
Many of deals were withdrawn by smaller, more specialist lenders. That may create added uncertainty for those with more chequered borrowing histories.

business	UK inflation rises at fastest rate for 40 years as food costs jump	"Prices are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for 40 years with food costs, particularly for bread, cereal and meat, climbing.
UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, edged up to 9.1% in the 12 months to May, from 9% in April, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
Fuel and energy prices are the biggest drivers of inflation, but the ONS said food costs had pushed it up further.
Workers and unions are pushing for pay rises to cope with higher prices.
But the government has warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s style ""inflationary spiral"" where firms hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers through higher prices.
Currently, inflation is at the highest level since March 1982, when it also stood at 9.1% and the Bank of England has warned it will reach 11% this year.
Inflation is the pace at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs £1 and that rises by 5p compared with a year earlier, then milk inflation is 5%.
In a BBC-commissioned survey of more than 4,000 people, 82% said they thought their wages should increase to match the rising price of goods and services.
Households were hit by an unprecedented £700-a-year increase in energy costs in April, and fuel price rises in June mean it costs more than £100 to fill an average family car with petrol.
Rail workers walked out on Tuesday causing severe disruption, with further strikes planned for Thursday and Saturday in a dispute over pay, jobs and conditions.
Rail, Maritime and Transport union is calling for a pay rise of 7%, while employers have offered a maximum of 3%.
Unison, which represents public sector workers, accused ministers of ""living on another planet"" over ""talks of public sector pay restraint"".
""Under-pressure health, care, school and council services desperately need staff to be given a pay boost that matches runaway prices,"" assistant general secretary Jon Richards said.
ggest teachers' union is also warning of potential industrial action over pay.
National Education Union has criticised government proposals for a 3% pay increase for most teachers in England, and called for an ""inflation-plus increase for all teachers"".
But Dominic Raab told the BBC's Today programme: ""We have got to stop making the problem worse by fuelling pay demands that will only see inflation stay higher for longer and that only hurts the poorest the worst.""
ONS said rising prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages helped fuel inflation in May.
Russia's war in Ukraine has severely restricted wheat and maize supplies, which are used to make bread and cereals, from two of the world's biggest exporters.
Ukraine is also a major producer of sunflower oil, meaning the costs of alternatives have also climbed.
Market research firm Kantar has forecast that the average annual grocery bill in the UK is set to rise by £380 this year.
Supermarket Asda told the BBC some shoppers are setting £30 limits at checkouts and petrol pumps, with customers putting less in their baskets and switching to budget ranges.
Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said ""widespread food price rises"" meant the cost of goods leaving factories had risen at their fastest rate in 45 years in May, with the cost of raw materials at the highest on record.
But he said the steep rises in food and record high petrol prices in May had been stemmed by the price of clothes rising less than they did this time last year, along with a drop in computer game costs.
ONS also revealed average UK house prices increased by 12.4% in the year to April, with average prices now £281,000, £31,000 higher than this time last year.
Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, said after families paid for essentials, ""the amount of spare cash left over to spending on days out, socialising and other treats is shrinking at an astonishing rate"".
Mum Georgia, from Birmingham, said she was having to cut back on trips with her daughter Harper-Faye as a result of prices rises.
""I haven't got the money to go to Sea Life Centres and stuff. That's like, £25 a ticket,"" said she said. ""I can't go out as much as I used to, not a chance. I can't afford it.""
Responding to the latest inflation rate, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was ""using all the tools at our disposal to bring inflation down and combat rising prices"".
government has provided a  package of measures, worth £15bn in total, to help people cope with soaring prices.
But Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor said the country needed ""more than sticking plasters to get us back on course - we need a stronger, and more secure economy"". 
Liberal Democrat treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine called for a cut in VAT, adding: ""This chancellor has hiked taxes time and time again, refusing to slash them to help with the cost of living emergency.""
re's no respite from the relentless rise in prices. While at least the rate of rise in inflation appears to have slowed, this is just a pause for breath. Further records in petrol prices and a renewed surge in the price of internationally traded gas after a fire at a key US gas terminal, mean a hot summer, and tricky autumn.
Right now we are also seeing the impact of a notable fall in sterling, compounding the global inflationary pressures, and helping to explain why UK inflation is higher than the rest of the G7.
Inflation this high is disastrous for the personal finances of millions of households, especially as food prices are unarguably surging. ""Squeeze"" doesn't quite capture how some working families are seeing their entire disposable income wiped out by monthly energy direct debits, or turning up at supermarkets asking the cashiers to stop the till at £30 or £40.
Bank of England may not see this data as a reason to ""act forcefully"" which many see as code for a half a per cent rise in August. They will continue to watch the evolution of wage settlements. While there is little evidence of a spiral in wages and prices so far, it is clear we are at a critical moment for the jobs market. 
With vacancies at record levels, unions see a one-off opportunity to increase wages, and will continue to push for double digit rises, for example rejecting Rolls Royce's £2,000 cost of living payment. Employers including the government will resist, but workers may find some wind in their sails in negotiations.
One way to try to control how fast prices are rising is to raise interest rates. The aim of this is to increase the cost of borrowing and encourage people to borrow and spend less, and save more.
In a bid to stem the pace of soaring prices, the Bank of England recently increased UK interest rates from 1% to 1.25%.

business	More mortgage lenders pull deals on rate rise fears	"Santander and Yorkshire Building Society have now suspended mortgage deals after a fall in the pound fuelled forecasts of rising interest rates.
A number of lenders have temporarily halted mortgage offers for new customers.
Meanwhile, Nationwide said it will lift rates on a range of fixed mortgages.
On Tuesday, the Bank of England's chief economist said that action would have to be taken - an indication that interest rates could rise sharply.
In a speech, Huw Pill said: ""I think it is hard not to draw the conclusion that all this will require a significant monetary policy response.""
Economists now expect interest rates to more than double to 5.8% by April, from the current level of 2.25%. Interest rates had previously been forecast to hit 4% by next May.
Lenders that are suspending mortgage offers for new customers include HSBC, Santander, Post Office, Skipton Building Society and Virgin Money.
Lucian Cook, head of residential research at estate agency Savills, said fixed-rate mortgages were ""incredibly difficult to price at the moment"" because there is a lack of certainty over interest rates. 
umber of residential mortgages on offer by lenders fell to 3,596 on Tuesday, compared with 3,961 deals on Friday when the government announced a mini-budget, according to financial information firm Moneyfacts.
Julie-Ann Haines, chief executive at Principality Building Society, said lenders had to ""stress-test"" mortgages to make sure that if the Bank of England base rates go up customers can still afford their monthly payments.
She said the reason mortgage rates were going up quite quickly in recent months was because banks and building societies have to be able to make a margin.
Economists began forecasting a hike in interest rates when the pound plunged against the dollar on Monday.
me after Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng pledged more tax cuts on top of a £45bn package he had already announced at a ""mini-budget"" on Friday.
Bank of England issued a statement on Monday saying that it would ""not hesitate"" to raise interest rates after the pound hit record lows.
Overnight, the pound stabilised at $1.08 but is still at its lowest level against the dollar for 37 years.
Sales assistant Robin Price, who is on the minimum wage, has been saving up his mortgage deposit for years and thanks to that and an inheritance, is now ready to buy. But with the threat of a sharp rise in interest rates looming, he says he now feels completely lost.
""I just want a home,"" says the 38-year-old, who fears monthly mortgage repayments will become unaffordable to him just when he wanted to buy his own place.
""I can't find anywhere that I can afford a mortgage on in London or Essex because I don't earn enough,"" he says. ""If I was in a couple it would probably be a different story.""
Mr Price moved out of his rental property to live with his sister in Suffolk while waiting to find somewhere to buy.
""Then Covid hit and I'm still struggling to find somewhere. I'm unsure what to do.""
Friday's mini-budget offered help to first-time buyers by cutting stamp duty, the tax paid when people buy a property in England and Northern Ireland.
But any savings Mr Price could have made from this will be wiped out if interest rates more than double.
Mr Price says he is now looking at houses closer to his father in Norfolk, but fears he will not be able to get a mortgage deal.
Chancellor's plans will require a large increase in government borrowing. 
Concerns among investors about the UK's ability to pay that debt led to the value of the pound falling and pushed the cost of UK government borrowing to near record levels.
Experts said a rise in the cost of long-term borrowing meant the current cost to mortgage lenders of offering new deals was now more expensive. 
re are also concerns that would-be borrowers will rush to secure mortgages at favourable rates before interest rates rise and if they do jump, some homeowners may not be able to afford higher repayments.
A weaker pound makes imports and goods priced in dollars, such as oil, much more costly, and risks fuelling price rises at a time when UK inflation is at its highest for 40 years. 
Some 8.3 million people have mortgages in the UK, according to banking trade body UK Finance.
Bank of England has already lifted interest rates seven times in a row since December to the highest rate in 14 years. 
Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said if interest rates rise as predicted, the average household refinancing a two-year fixed rate mortgage in the first half of next year would see monthly payments jump to £1,490 from £863. 
""Many simply won't be able to afford this,"" he said.
Changes to mortgage deals include: 
Yorkshire Building Society said: ""As a result of the current volatile market conditions, we will be temporarily withdrawing our range of mortgages for new customers at 8pm tonight.
""All applications submitted prior to this will continue as normal."" 
Virgin Money and Skipton Building Society also said applications that have been submitted will proceed. 
Halifax said from Wednesday it would remove mortgage products that come with a fee ""as a result of significant changes in mortgage market pricing we've seen over recent weeks"".
Mortgage deals that have product fees can result in lower monthly repayments for homeowners, with the fee being added to the total mortgage debt. The overall cost of the loan will be higher due to more interest accruing over time.
HSBC UK said that to stay within its operational capacity it needed to limit its range for the rest of the day. 
""Our broker products will be available again on Wednesday 28 September,"" it said. ""We continue to review the situation regularly.""
Post Office said it had temporarily withdrawn all residential and buy-to-let mortgages, adding it will ""be launching new ranges as soon as possible"".
""Customers who have already applied for a mortgage rate with the Post Office will be able to proceed with this rate as normal,"" it said.
Atom bank said its temporary withdrawal of its range of mortgages had ""no impact on anyone who has a valid mortgage offer from us"".
It said it would continue to support existing customers who are looking to vary or move their mortgage and would aim to return to mortgage lending as soon as possible.

business	Government borrowing lower than expected in April	"Government borrowing was lower than expected in April, although the figure was still the fourth-highest total for the month since records began.
Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was £18.6bn, down £5.6bn from April last year.
Office for National Statistics also cut its estimate for borrowing in the previous financial year.
One analyst said the figures would put pressure on the chancellor to ""go big"" on a support package for households.  
With the cost of living rising at its fastest pace for 40 years, there have been calls for the government to provide extra help.
Opposition parties have called for a windfall tax on energy firms, and while the government has resisted such a measure so far, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said ""no option is off the table"" to tackle rising living costs.
ONS cut its estimate for borrowing during the previous financial year by £7.2bn to £144.6bn, although this was still the third-highest financial year borrowing total since records began in 1947.
""The lower-than-expected public borrowing of £18.6bn in April and the downward revisions to borrowing in 2021-22 will only add to the pressure on the chancellor to go big when finalising the imminent support package for households,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
However, he added: ""We think any support will be small and targeted rather than big and widespread.""
Borrowing surged during the pandemic as the government spent billions to support the economy. However, borrowing has fallen back as the economy has recovered and as the government ended measures such as the furlough scheme.
April's borrowing total was lower than expected, with the government's independent forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility - having predicted £19.1bn.
month saw the first contributions to government revenues of the increase to National Insurance. But spending during April also included the £3bn cost of the council tax rebate, under which many households will receive £150 to help with higher energy bills.
Interest payments on government borrowing were £4.4bn, which was lower than expected. However, analysts expect this figure to surge in the months ahead, as interest paid on government bonds rises with increases in the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation.
""Following the latest spike in RPI inflation, we now expect monthly interest spending to reach an eye-watering £16bn in June,"" said Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG UK.
Chancellor Rishi Sunak, said: ""While we are doing what we can to help families deal with rising prices, inflation is also pushing up our spending on debt interest - which is expected to reach £83bn this year.
""We must take a balanced and responsible approach to support people now, while also not burdening future generations, and we're on track to drive public debt down by 2024-25.""
Government debt - the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years - stood at £2.35 trillion in April. 
figure almost exceeds the size of the UK economy, with debt having reached 95.7% of gross domestic product (GDP). 
A separate survey of companies indicated that growth in the UK's private sector has slowed to its weakest in 15 months.
monthly purchasing managers' index - which surveys senior managers at companies who take buying and hiring decisions - fell sharply in May to 51.8 from 58.2 in April, although a figure above 50 still implies activity is growing.
Manufacturers reported the steepest drop in export orders since June 2020. A number of goods producers cited Brexit-related trade frictions as the main factor contributing to lower export sales in May, especially in relation to new customs rules, extra documentation requirements and other complexities with EU trade. 
Business expectations eased to the lowest for two years in May amid worries about the global economic outlook and downbeat projections for consumer spending."
business	Supermarket petrol stations to close for Queen's funeral	"Petrol stations at the UK's major supermarkets will be closed for most of the day of the Queen's funeral, before some reopen in the evening.
, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons will close forecourts on Monday before some reopen at 17:00 BST.
It is understood only a small number of Tesco self service fuel stations will reopen in the evening and customers have been advised to check local pumps.
Supermarkets operate about one-in-five of forecourts, but dominate fuel sales.
Independent traders operate about two-in-three of the country's filling stations, but only sell just over a third of all fuel, and the remainder is accounted for by sites owned by oil companies, according to the RAC motoring group.
""With many supermarket forecourts closed until the evening on Monday, our advice to drivers needing to refuel is to seek out a good value independent filling station that's choosing to stay open, or top up over the weekend instead,"" RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said.
Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent fuel retailers, has been contacted for comment.
Morrisons said that while all of its supermarkets will be closed on Monday as a ""mark of respect and so colleagues can pay tribute to Her Majesty"", its petrol stations would reopen at 17:00.
However, the majority of its fuel stations have different opening times so drivers have been urged to check if local ones are open on the company's website. 
Sainsbury's said its filling stations will be open from 17:00 to 22:00 on Monday to allow customers to ""pick up essential items"".
""We thank our customers for their understanding,"" the supermarket said in a statement.
Major shops and businesses across the UK have announced they will shut their doors as a mark of respect for Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral.
King Charles III approved a bank holiday on Monday for the state funeral at Westminster Abbey, but it is up to employers to decide whether to give staff the day off to observe the national day of mourning.
Shell said it would close its company-owned petrol stations between 10:30 and 13:00.
giant has a total of 1,123 sites in the UK and owns and operates 526 of them. The remaining 597 are owned by independent dealers, which trade under the brand.
mpany said its intention was the shut during the funeral service to ""allow staff and customers to pay their respects"". 
It said the opening hours of its independent stations were at the ""discretion of individual business"", but added that the company had ""invited them to also consider closing to enable their staff and customers to pay their respects"".    "
business	Business confidence is falling, says Natwest boss	"f living crisis presents challenges because so many firms and customers have no experience of high inflation and rising lending rates, NatWest boss Alison Rose has said.
Firms on the bank's books have falling confidence, she told BBC Scotland.
Ms Rose blamed this on problems with supply chains, energy bills and skills shortages.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also ""exacerbated"" people's worries, she added. 
ree years after she took over the top role from Ross McEwan, and renamed Royal Bank of Scotland, or RBS, with the Natwest brand, Ms Rose said that the impact of inflation, higher interest rates and the invasion of Ukraine has caused a ""concern"" for business about ""confidence to grow"". 
""We are still seeing positive tailwinds from recovery from the pandemic as companies scale back up again, but definitely business confidence is being affected,"" she said. 
She added business customers of Natwest are not pulling back on investment, though there is cautiousness about long-term projects. 
""We're seeing people increasing investment in working capital as they re-engineer their supply chains,"" Ms Rose said.
""One of the challenges we all need to recognise is that, for a lot of business owners and lot of families, an environment of inflation and rising interest rates is not something they've had to deal with for a long period of time.""
Interest rates were cut sharply during the financial crisis in 2008-09, when RBS had the biggest balance sheet of any bank in the world, ran into severe difficulties with its exposure to bad lending, and had to be bailed out with a £45bn capital injection by the UK government. 
It is only this month that the Bank of England base interest rate has returned to 1%, and the current Consumer Price Index, at 9%, is at its highest level for 40 years and continuing to rise. 
So it is a falling minority of people in Britain who remember the problems of living with high inflation, and few in business could remember both rising at the same time.
Ms Rose, who joined Natwest 30 years ago, said the bank has relationship managers who can offer experience of getting through turmoil in business conditions.
""People are really anxious and worried about all those trends, so we encourage them to come and talk to us, because there are things we can do and we can help with,"" she explained.
f executive said the bank is not seeing signs of mortgage arrears rising or bad debt more widely.
""As we came out of the pandemic, a lot of businesses built a lot of liquidity on their balance sheet. One of the things we've focussed on is helping people save and put money away for a rainy day. 
""We're not seeing any of those early warning indicators around bad debts or insolvencies or even calls coming into our financial health and support teams.
""But we're very acutely aware that people are worried about those challenges. We encourage customers to get in touch if they are worried.""
finance sector has seen pay rise ahead of inflation, unlike almost every other sector. RBS bonuses this year were up 44%. 
While others face falling real incomes, the Natwest boss defended bank pay as fair and competitive with other banks, while the bonus pool is declining.
""We recognise that we get well paid in the finance sector, but the majority of our staff don't get bonuses. The majority are on fixed pay,"" she said.
""We've always said we would pay fairly and competitively. Our staff are paid above minimum wage. Also it's important to bring the right talent into our organisation so that we can support our customers.""
On very low savings rates for customers of Natwest and Royal Bank of Scotland and its Ulster Bank brand - only 0.15% on the premium saver account and 0.45% on ISA cash - the chief executive responded: ""We've got to balance all those elements. We've always said we will pass on rates, to keep that in balance to make sure we're doing that responsibly and fairly.""
Also in the interview, looking back at her time in the investment bank, while its operations were close to bringing Royal Bank of Scotland crashing down in 2008, Ms Rose recalled it as a ""really difficult time"".
""I've had my whole career here, and I remember the financial crisis clearly, and the impact we can have on people's lives when things go wrong. That's driven a huge part of my commitment to rebuilding part of the bank's reputation,"" she said.
""I remember walking the floors, talking to more junior people, trying to provide reassurance. What I saw was a lot of my colleagues - good people, doing good work, traumatised by what happened, (feeling) it wasn't the bank they recognised. That wasn't what they did.""
She reflects that the last two chief executives - Mr McEwan and Stephen Hester - were in a fight for survival, whereas her job is about focussing on the future and growth, about building relationships more than being a bank purely for transactions.
And on the move away from its Scottish branding, she said Natwest remains proud of its Scottish heritage, banking one in three Scottish businesses, one in five households and one in seven Scottish mortgages, while being a major employer north of the border."
business	Heathrow passenger limit may return for Christmas	"Heathrow Airport could impose a cap on passenger numbers at busy times around Christmas, bosses have said.
A 100,000 daily cap imposed over the summer due to staff shortages will be lifted at the end of October.
But Heathrow warned it could return ""if needed"" to avoid flight cancellations in the run-up to the festive period.
rport said passenger numbers were unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels ""for a number of years"" but it needed to recruit thousands more staff.
Heathrow bosses expect there to be 25% fewer travellers this year compared to 2019, with up to 62 million people passing through.
-of-living crisis, Ukraine war and impact of Covid had hit demand for international travel, it said.
John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Britain's largest airport told the BBC the airport wanted to ""get back to full capacity as soon as possible"".
""We don't want to have a cap at all,"" he told the Today programme. ""The reason for having a cap is to make sure we keep supply and demand in balance.
""It was absolutely the right thing to do over the summer. It meant for the summer holidays people could get away with confidence.""
But Virgin Atlantic urged the airport to avoid passenger capacity limits during the Christmas travel window ""that would ruin customer plans"".
""Virgin Atlantic remains ready to deliver a full winter schedule and we expect Heathrow to do the same,"" the airline said.
usands of passengers have faced delays and flight cancellations in recent months with airports and airlines struggling to recruit enough staff to cope with the surge in demand for international travel, following the removal of Covid restrictions.
Airports and airlines cut thousands of jobs at the height of the pandemic, and many workers haven't returned to the industry due to finding other jobs. 
How have you been affected by flight disruptions or cancellations? Get in touch via:
Heathrow said some 75,000 jobs across 400 organisations operating at the airport had been cut down to 50,000 during the pandemic. 
usinesses need to recruit back up to full head count in roles including ground handlers, airline and retail staff to meet demand, it said. There are about 13,000 outstanding vacancies, the BBC understands.
Over the summer, airlines across the UK were asked to cut flights from schedules and Heathrow itself faced baggage handling problems, which resulted in a sea of luggage piling up at Terminal 2 after a technical malfunction.
In a bid to curb cancellations, Heathrow imposed its 100,000 daily cap over the peak summer season and despite the policy, the airport said it was the busiest in Europe, with 18 million people passing through its terminals.
But July move prompted a backlash from one of its main airlines Emirates, which initially rejected the airport's demands to stop selling summer tickets, calling it ""unreasonable and unacceptable"".
It accused airport of having a ""blatant disregard"" for customers and said it faced ""an 'airmageddon' situation due to their incompetence and non-action"", before the Dubai-based airline later agreed to the cap.
rade body for airlines, Airlines UK, said Heathrow ""must ensure"" that any new limit introduced in the run-up to the festive period is ""justified and has as little impact on traveller plans as possible"". 
""Going forward, as the UK's only hub airport it must ensure its overly pessimistic forecasts on passenger numbers - exceeded significantly this year - don't leave the airport short on resource when planning for future demand,"" it added.
Mr Holland-Kaye called on the government to help with speeding up security checks required when airports are hiring staff. He said having access to HMRC data of where applicants had worked for the past five years would be the ""simplest thing to help us"".
government has previously said it has introduced a ""range of measures to help process security checks as quickly as possible"", claiming about 97% of accreditation checks are completed in five days on average.
Department for Transport has said it has provided flexibility for employers to start new staff on certain training courses while their background checks are ongoing.
Despite lower passenger numbers, Heathrow returned a pre-tax profit of £643m in the nine months to the end of September. This followed a heavy £1.4bn loss over the same period last year."
business	House sales peak in July but buyers are cautious	"More homes were sold in the UK in July than in any other month this year, official figures show, but agents say buyers are showing more caution.
Cost-of-living pressures were leading some to negotiate harder for a lower price, agents said.
A total of 110,970 properties were sold in the UK during the month - the highest since September, HM Revenue and Customs data shows.
Activity in the housing market usually picks up during the warmer months.
Sales surged during, and despite of, the pandemic as people searched for more inside and outdoor space, then slowed in the second half of last year.
Consistent monthly sales of around 100,000 this year show that demand remains comparatively strong, but there are signs that the squeeze on budgets caused by rising prices and bills were having an effect.
Sales in July were still 33% higher than the same month last year and 7.2% higher than June, HMRC said.
Nathan Emerson, chief executive of the estate agents' trade body Propertymark, said: ""These figures show the housing market remains stable with transactions up month-on-month, year-on-year and well above pre-pandemic levels.
""The cost of living is still rising and we are seeing evidence of buyers negotiating harder, bringing price increases down. But our data from member agents shows the demand remains strong and that there with not enough stock to go round with the number of new potential buyers seven times higher than new homes coming to the market.""
Other commentators have suggested that more nervous buyers could lead to lower prices. Property portal Rightmove recently suggested that asking prices had dropped for the first time this year in August.
North London estate agent Jeremy Leaf said ""concerns about the rising cost of living and interest rates are prompting a more cautious approach"" from buyers, which meant sales were taking a little longer than previously.
Bank of England has regularly raised interest rates as the cost of living has soared, meaning new buyers are facing more expensive mortgages than seen in recent years.
Julie-Ann Haines, chief executive of the Principality Building Society, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that another 1.8 million homeowners were coming to the end of a fixed-rate home loan next year, so demand and pressure on banks and building societies was increasing.
She added that there were no signs of a UK housing market crash, although a slowdown was more likely."
business	Supermarket push to cut waste hits food bank donations	"Food waste charity Fareshare has told the BBC it has seen a drop of around 200 tonnes in supermarket surplus donations every month this summer.
rity said the reduction had come at the same time as demand for the services they support surged.
BBC understands Fareshare is writing to major supermarkets, asking for an increase in contributions. 
, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Asda and Waitrose all told the BBC their donations were steady.
Sainsbury's and Asda said they were also committed to reducing food waste with Sainsburys acknowledging this could affect donations.
Fareshare redistributes food waste to smaller charitable and community projects across the UK.
One is the Place of Welcome at St James church in Broughton, Salford, which offers free hot dinners as well as a £2.50 pantry for locals in need. 
Reverend Christine Threlfall tells the BBC that what she has to give out has halved in recent months. 
""We help a real mix of people: pensioners, young families, working people and the unemployed,"" she says. ""They all have one thing in common. Prices are skyrocketing but their income is the same."" 
Demand for help at the church has doubled since the pandemic. Christine and her team of volunteers have seen queues round the block. She says Fareshare food is a lifeline for desperate residents, but it needs to be the right food.
""A lot of our customers are telling us they are turning off their fridges and ovens. They can't afford to run them,"" Christine explains. That's why ready meals and simple suppers are important, or for volunteers to be able to cook a big stew to dish out, she says. 
""But now we just don't have the ingredients."" 
Fareshare said there was less waste food due to a combination of ongoing global food production and supply chain issues.
At the same time, supermarkets are striving to be more efficient and waste less, in order to keep prices for their customers low. 
Carl Hawkes, head of network at the charity, explained that donations from supermarket warehouses were particularly valuable. 
""If you're a community group trying to make a meal, out of say, beetroot, that's really hard,"" he said. 
""Whereas the retail food is very mixed. It's much easier for our charities and beneficiaries to make meals out of what they send.""
Mr Hawkes showed the BBC around the Barnsley depot in South Yorkshire.
At that location alone, Fareshare is taking in 40 fewer pallets of surplus food each month. It is particularly noticeable in the fridge, he explains, which was less than half full and lacking in staples like meat and dairy.
rity is at pains to explain they have no problem with supermarkets wasting less - but it poses a challenge for them to continue to support so many charities that depend on waste food. 
""Supermarkets at the moment are more willing to sell wonky fruit and veg than they may previously have done, or to sell food with slightly less shelf life on it - and that food would have traditionally have come to us,"" he explained.
But he is worried about those in need this winter. 
Barnsley site supports 400 groups, from food banks to breakfast clubs, some homeless shelters and housing associations. 
""There are so many people struggling to feed themselves or their families,"" Mr Hawkes added.
""As an organisation we would far rather see families fed. It is a shame organisations like this exist but in such times it is great we can provide support to the communities we operate in."" 
As well as writing to supermarkets, the charity is casting its net wider, looking into food waste opportunities from British farming and working with a more diverse mix of smaller food manufacturers, hotels and restaurants. 
One is Fullers, which makes frozen chips and vegetable products that most major retailers stock under its own brand.
usiness has started donating spare stock from its warehouses, as well as the prototype and test food from head office to Fareshare. 
Managing director Kevin Smith said it made sense on many levels. 
""If we send food to landfill, we get charged for that,"" he explained. ""It makes absolute commercial sense for us to do it. Plus it feels like we're doing something that puts back into the community."" 
But tapping into waste food as businesses of all kinds seek to be leaner in their operations will pose a challenge. Mr Smith also said that higher demand for products meant the pressure was on to order smart and not make errors that could lead to waste. 
BBC also spoke to manufacturer Kellogg's, which has a long-standing commitment to back breakfast clubs and has redistributed over 18 million servings of cereal in 2022 so far - more than last year. 
But alongside this, the business recognised a drive to reduce waste, too.
""Like every business, we are trying to be as efficient as possible and look at our costs,"" said Paul Wheeler, communications director at Kellogg's UK.
""We are trying to manage down the amount of food we give, which causes a problem. Because as we do that, the demand for Fareshare and other charities is like never before.""
BBC contacted Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Asda and Waitrose regarding food waste donations. All said that supporting charities such as Fareshare was important to them, and that food waste donations as a whole were steady, and to a broad range of organisations. 
But alongside this, Sainsbury's and Asda did also add that reducing food waste was an important commitment within the business.
""We are aware this could impact the volumes we are able to redistribute to charities to support their beneficiaries,"" a Sainsbury's spokesperson explained. "
business	Germany beer bottle shortage: Industry warns of 'tense' situation	"German breweries are warning there could be a shortage of beer bottles this summer amid rising production costs and a shortage of lorry drivers.
uation is ""extremely tense"", the chief executive of the German Brewers' Federation told German newspaper Bild.
rtage of glass bottles will mainly affect small- and medium-sized breweries, an industry expert said.
Brewers are having to pay 80% more for new glass bottles than they did a year ago. The cost of beer is also rising.
One of the reasons behind the shortage is a hike in energy prices which is causing the price of glass bottle production to increase, a glass industry spokesperson told Bild.
In addition, Holger Eichele of the German Brewers' Federation said a lack of lorry drivers was making it harder to maintain supply chains. 
As a result, he said the cost of new glass bottles had nearly doubled in the last year. 
It follows warnings that the cost of German beer could rise by up to 30%, also due largely to the increase in energy prices. 
rtage of bottles is likely to hit smaller breweries the hardest, because the bigger companies are typically supplied first. 
Mr Eichele said the best thing Germans could do was to return glass bottles to retailers as quickly as possible, advising consumers not to ""hoard empties in the basement"".
Glass bottles, which are common in Germany, are sold with a small deposit, and beer drinkers are expected to bring them back to the shop when getting their next round.
Cans, used elsewhere in the world, are far less common and many breweries use customised bottles that are tricky to replace."
business	John Lewis and DFS warn shoppers are spending less	"Retailers John Lewis and DFS have said customers are cutting back on the amount they spend due to the rising cost of living.
John Lewis said while shopper numbers were higher than last year, customers were spending less and avoiding buying as many ""big ticket"" items.
""No one could have predicted the scale of the cost of living crisis,"" said John Lewis boss Dame Sharon White.
mpany reported a loss of £99m for the first half of its trading year.
Sofa retailer DFS Furniture reported slumping annual profits due to a dip in consumer spending, saying order numbers had ""softened markedly"" as shoppers tightened their belts.
Also on Thursday, fashion chain H&M filed lower-than-expected quarterly sales., but said it had seen a ""better start for the autumn collections than last year"".
Dame Sharon said customers were less likely to splash out on ""big ticket"" household items and were moving their spending to dining out at restaurants and to holidays.
""No one could have predicted the scale of the cost of living crisis that has materialised, with energy prices and inflation rising ahead of anyone's expectations,"" she said.
""As a business, we have faced unprecedented cost inflation across grocery and general merchandise.""
However, she said it was ""not unusual"" for the John Lewis Partnership to report a loss in the first half of the year as its trading is ""heavily skewed"" to Christmas, with most of its profits made in the final months of the year.
In the first half of last year, the partnership reported a loss of £29m.
mpany said its losses this year were due to a combination of rising wholesale prices for goods not being passed on to customers, households cutting back on spending, and the ""unwinding"" of Covid shopping habits.
It said it chose to ""forgo"" profit to help staff and customers through the cost-of-living crisis. The employee-owned group announced a £500 one-off payment to full-time workers, with a pro-rata amount for those working part-time, to support staff.
Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the ""fight is on for consumers' remaining disposable cash"".
She said DFS was the ""latest"" company to warn of the the ""painful effects"" of inflation. 
""DFS is not only having to cope with a slowdown due to purchases which were brought forward during the pandemic, but now as household bills mount for essentials like food and heating, a plush new sofa is a luxury many consumers are happy to do without,"" she said.
Overall UK inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, is running near a 40-year high, but the rate eased for the first time in almost a year in August, slipping to 9.9% from July's 10.1%.
Food prices have been increasing around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been one of the factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills, and Waitrose said its sales were down 5% on last year, with basket sizes ""smaller by nearly a fifth"".
Bank of England has warned inflation could top 13% this year, and is expected to keep increasing interest rates in an attempt to control it.
John Lewis said its fashion sales increased as people shopped for travel and summer breaks. However, revenue from its home and technology ranges, which performed well during the height of the pandemic, declined.
mpany said the impact of the rise in the cost of living, specifically around energy costs, was ""evident in patterns of spending"", with sales of its own-brand items rising 28% and energy saving goods, such as air fryers and smart thermostats, increasing.
Dame Sharon said the outlook for the rest of the year was ""highly uncertain owing to the cost of living crisis and its impact on discretionary spending as well as criticality of our Christmas trading period"".
She said a successful Christmas was ""key for the business"", adding a bumper festive period beyond previous years was needed to ""generate sufficient profit"" for the company to be able to pay staff their usual bonus.
Last month, Dame Sharon told the BBC that an exodus of over-50s who left the workforce during the Covid pandemic had fuelled wage inflation.
UK has seen one million people, mostly in their 50s, leave work since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, with job vacancies at a record high.
It has meant employers who want to attract and retain staff are under pressure to lift wages, which in turn fuels inflation."
business	Rising prices see basic pay fall at fastest rate in a decade	"Regular pay is falling at the fastest rate in more than a decade when taking into account rising prices, the Office for National Statistics has said.
Between February and April, pay excluding bonuses was down 2.2% from a year earlier when adjusted for inflation, the ONS said.
UK household budgets are being squeezed by record fuel and energy costs.
However, pay including bonuses is outpacing price rises, rising by 0.4% when taking inflation into account.
Sam Beckett, head of economic statistics at the ONS, said a ""high level of bonuses"" was continuing to ""cushion the effects of rising prices on total earnings for some workers"".
""But if you exclude bonuses, pay in real terms is falling at its fastest rate in over a decade,"" she added.
Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed the UK's jobs market ""remains robust"" with redundancies at an all-time low.
""Helping people into work is the best way to support families in the long term, and we are continuing to support people into new and better jobs,"" he added.
But Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said ""millions in work are in poverty"" and accused ministers of showing ""utter complacency about the huge levels of economic inactivity"".
When adjusted for inflation, regular pay has fallen roughly by 1.6% for private sector workers and 4.5% for those in the public sector.
ONS noted that the latest wage figures are compared with the same period in 2021 when Covid restrictions were in place and some workers were furloughed.
umber of job vacancies in the UK rose to a new record of 1.3 million from March to May, the ONS said.
unemployment rate stood at 3.8% in the February to April period, up slightly from last month, while the employment rate was 75.6%, which is still lower than before the pandemic.

Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said that with record numbers of roles available, ""pay is growing strongly as companies seek to attract people to work for them"".
But he warned if ""we don't address the fact that there are not enough people looking for work, this could put another dampener on the UK's economic growth"".
Josh Goodall, the co-managing director of building company Elite Building Maintenance in West Yorkshire, told the BBC that trying to recruit experienced tradespeople such as builders, joiners and plasterers was ""an absolute nightmare"" in the current climate.
""We have got a couple of young lads working for us and they are currently getting trained up at the moment, but you can only train so many people and you need experienced workers,"" he said.
job vacancies showed hospitality and healthcare were among the sectors with the highest number of jobs available, with construction and manufacturing also having high vacancy numbers.
Mr Goodall said that as a result of the tight labour market, he was having to raise wages, with an experienced builder now asking for about £250 per day, compared with about £150 before the pandemic.
, along with the soaring costs of materials such as timber and cement, has led to the company charging more.
""We are almost apologising [to customers] saying materials have gone up, fuel has gone up, waste costs have gone up,"" said Mr Goodall.  
""We feel like it's an expensive price but the amount we are making is less than it was before.""
jobs numbers remain a welcome relief from the stagflation seen elsewhere in the UK figures, but the strength here appears to be peaking.
Unemployment remains very low and there was an overall rise in employment over the past three months, though not yet recovering all the lost jobs since before the pandemic.
Still there were some signs of a turning point under the hood of these numbers. Unemployment actually edged up a little. And looking at the single month figures for April, when energy bills spiked and taxes went up, unemployment was up to 4.2% and employment notably down.
For those with jobs, ordinary pay fell in real terms at the fastest rate for a decade. In the private sector, bonuses are cushioning this for some workers reflecting one-off payments and recruitment into new jobs. 
Vacancies remain at record levels too, with a worker shortage starting to have visible consequences at airports and in the NHS. But the defining economic question still to be answered is how much wages can compensate for the surge in the rate of price rises. The answer so far is not much, especially in the public sector.
ONS added the the number of ""economically inactive"" people - those without a job and not seeking to work - had fallen slightly in the past three months, but was still higher than before Covid struck.
Wilson, director of the Institute of Employment Studies, tweeted that the ""incredibly tight"" labour market reflected a smaller workforce than before the pandemic, with up to one million workers now ""missing"".
Ms Beckett from the ONS said that at the start of the pandemic many young people leaving education had ""disengaged"" from looking for work due to most businesses and work places being shut during lockdowns.
But she told the BBC's Today programme that the ""story had changed"" more recently with more people over the age of 50 becoming economically inactive by ""retiring early, or just not needing to work, or indeed suffering ill health"". 
A member of the ""missing million"" is Kevin Butler, who retired from his 17-year career in recruitment to make music.
54-year-old said the pandemic changed his perspective on work when he was furloughed.
""I'm lucky in that I've worked for a long time and been sensible with money in the past and paid off my mortgage, and those little things that make a difference on an everyday basis,"" he added."
business	PwC says graduates do not need a 2:1 degree to work at the firm	"PwC, one of the UK's largest graduate employers, has said it will no longer just look for new recruits with a first or 2:1 degree.
untancy firm said accepting applicants with lower second class degrees would help increase the socio-economic diversity of its workforce.
""Talent and potential is determined by more than academic grades,"" PwC said.
Around 14% of graduates received a lower second class degree, or 2:2, last year.
UK universities award degrees that are classified in four categories: a first, an upper second (2:1), a lower second (2:2), and third class honours. 
rofessional services firms, including large city, accountancy and law firms, have required students to have a 2:1 or above.
When Stephanie Ahemor, 32, graduated with a 2:2 she struggled. 
""It was definitely harder to find a job right out of uni, as my grades meant I was automatically excluded from the majority of graduate programmes,"" she told the BBC. 
""I come from a working class family so… I didn't have a lot of connections.""
She took on a lot of unpaid internships and eventually got a job with the Home Office. But she wishes firms had accepted her 2:2 degree a decade ago.
""If the big four had considered this when I graduated I definitely would have applied to PwC and the others but I wasn't able to at that time.""
PwC said it was removing the requirement for all its graduate roles, internships and placements in order to open up opportunities for more people and improve social mobility.
""Whilst academic achievement has its place, for far too many students there are other factors that influence results,"" said Ian Elliott, chief people officer at PwC.
""This move isn't primarily about attracting more applications but opening our roles to students from a broader range of backgrounds,"" he added.
In the past decade, universities have awarded a higher proportion of first class degrees and fewer 2:2 degrees, while the proportion of students receiving a 2:1 has remained fairly flat.
g four accountancy firms - PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY - began to loosen the criteria for their traditional graduate recruitment programmes more than six years ago. EY and PwC both said then they would move away from the reliance on academic qualifications and put more emphasis on their own assessments.
Since then, disruption to schooling and universities during the Covid pandemic has focused attention on the extra challenges faced by students from disadvantaged backgrounds. 
A-level grades were inflated in 2020 and 2021 as a result of measures to help combat the disruption, which had a bigger impact in less affluent communities. But this year's A-level results, due out later this week, are expected to move some of the way back towards pre-pandemic standards, resulting in fewer achieving the top grades and fears that disadvantaged students will miss out on university places. 
At degree level, students from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to gain the top grades, said Universities UK, which represents the sector.
Recent research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests that what class of degree you have makes a big difference to earning potential five years down the line. It said a 2:2 degree was associated with a 6.9% lower earnings for women and 10.9% lower earnings for men, compared with a 2:1.
But PwC's motivation may not be purely about diversifying its intake, according to Gary Darlington, associate director at global recruitment firm Robert Walters.
He said high demand for staff following a recruitment lull in the pandemic, meant many firms were having to adapt their wish lists.
""We do have clients who are quite particular, they must have a [candidate with a] 2:1 degree. We have other clients where it goes further. It has to be from a redbrick university... It's a snobby thing.
""[But] I've found in more recent times companies have become more flexible.""
KPMG last year became one of the first large UK businesses to set a target for the number of employees it has from working class backgrounds. 
firm said that while it expects student applicants to be ""working toward"" a 2:1 degree, it assessed candidates on a case-by-case basis and would consider those with lower second class degrees.
Deloitte uses contextualised academic data, taking into account he economic and personal background of an applicant. 
r PwC has recruited around 1,200 graduates and approximately 15% of them are from lower socio-economic backgrounds. 
Around 39% of the UK workforce are working class, according to data from the Social Mobility Commission.

business	Firefighters to vote on strikes, union says	"Firefighters and control room staff are to vote on whether to go on strike after a 5% pay offer was rejected.
Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said the pay offer was ""derisory"" and a ""real-terms pay cut"".
Inflation jumped to 11.1% in the year to October, which was the highest rate in 41 years and up from 10.1% in September.
If FBU members do walk out, it will be the first time they have done so in almost a decade.
Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said: ""There is remarkable strength of feeling amongst firefighters and control staff on this derisory pay offer.
""We have firefighters using foodbanks. Our members worked through the pandemic to help protect their communities, taking on extra duties to do so. A further real-terms pay cut is an absolutely disgusting way to thank them.""
FBU said 32,000 of its members across the UK will be balloted on strike action between 5 December and 23 January.
Mr Wrack said strike action is ""always a last resort"", and said he would be writing to the government to call for urgent talks.
""There is still an opportunity to resolve this dispute,"" he said.
A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Setting firefighter pay is the responsibility of employers, working through the National Joint Council; the Home Office plays no role in the negotiation or funding of firefighter pay.
""We thank firefighters who work tirelessly to protect our communities and are committed to ensuring fire and rescue services have the resources they need to keep us safe.""
uncement by the FBU follows a wave of UK industrial action this year by tens of thousands of workers.
Employees across a swathe of different industries including rail, telecoms, ports and the postal sector have walked out, angry that pay rises being offered do not match their rising food and energy costs.
rall inflation rate is at its highest level since 1981, according to the Office for National Statistics."
business	Taylor Swift public ticket sale cancelled amid high demand	"kets to see Taylor Swift live in concert sold so swiftly the general public never even had a chance to buy.
ketmaster, the company selling seats to the singer's US tour, cancelled the public sale on Thursday, citing ""extraordinarily high demands on ticketing systems and insufficient remaining ticket inventory"".
It has already sold over two million tickets in pre-sales for select groups.
mpany has come under criticism after the demand crashed its website.
""I got so close three or four times and the website broke. It was agonising,"" said mum Nancy Abulmagd, one of the fans who had won a lottery to join the pre-sale.
She spent hours on Tuesday in a virtual queue, behind thousands of other people, trying to score seats for her 11-year-old daughter and friends, only to have the website crash repeatedly and eventually turn her away, empty-handed. 
""The experience was really deflating. It messed with your emotions and sucked up your whole day,"" the 41-year-old, who lives in New Jersey, said. 
firm has blamed the problems on a ""staggering number of bot attacks"" that overwhelmed its website as well as high demand for the singer, who first burst on the scene in 2006 and has supplied a steady stream of hits ever since.
Her latest album, Midnights, has topped charts around the world.  
mpany said more than 3.5 million Swifties, as her followers are known, registered in advance as ""verified fans"" in the hope of getting tickets for her 52-city US tour in the pre-sale. 
Sales for those special fans went on sale on Tuesday 15 November. 
ketmaster also hosted a pre-sale for people carrying a credit card from Capital One, the company sponsoring the 52-city tour.
Despite issues during the pre-sale that Ticketmaster estimated affected about 15% of interactions across the site, the company said it still sold more than 2 million tickets - the most ever for an artist in a single day.
On Thursday, Ticketmaster said Friday's public sale was cancelled.
""While it's impossible for everyone to get tickets to these shows, we know we can do more to improve the experience and that's what we're focused on,"" the company had said earlier.
ketmaster says the pre-sale system is intended to help prevent ticket touts - known as scalpers in the US - and bots from scooping up seats.
But the glitches in the process  - resale sites have already shown tickets for tens of thousands of dollars - have reignited anger at the firm, which has long faced complaints that it abuses its power over the industry.
In an episode of his HBO show Last Week Tonight earlier this year, British comedian John Oliver described Ticketmaster as ""one of the most hated companies on earth"" - blaming it for the high prices, exorbitant fees and scarce availability that confront those hoping to attend concerts and other events.
Pearl Jam aired concerns about Ticketmaster's role as the major ticket seller back in the 1990s. 
mpany's power has only grown since then. In 2010, it merged with Live Nation, which runs many of the country's event venues and has an artist management business. 
US Democratic lawmakers, who have called for that merger to be reversed, chimed in again amid the chaos of the Taylor Swift pre-sale.
""Ticketmaster's excessive wait times and fees are completely unacceptable, as seen with today's @taylorswift13 tickets, and are a symptom of a larger problem,"" wrote congressman David Cicilline, who oversees the House committee on competition and anti-trust. ""It's no secret that Live Nation-Ticketmaster is an unchecked monopoly.""
""Daily reminder that Ticketmaster is a monopoly, its merger with LiveNation should never have been approved, and they need to be reigned [sic] in,"" wrote left-wing congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. ""Break them up.""
Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment on the Taylor Swift affair on Wednesday. 
ketmaster is already subject to government monitoring, oversight that was imposed when the LiveNation purchase was approved.
rsight was extended a few years ago after regulators found the firm had violated the terms of the agreement.
And last month, US President Joe Biden - who has expressed concern that monopolies have become more common across the economy - said his administration would look into fees on concert tickets. 
Krista Brown, senior policy analyst at the American Economic Liberties Project, is part of a coalition of artists and others who launched a campaign last month calling on the government to break up Ticketmaster.
She said she was hopeful that the outrage from Taylor Swift's massive fan base would raise pressure on the administration to act.
""If there was healthy competition in this space, [these problems] just wouldn't be present and customers or fans would have other services to turn to,"" she said. ""You probably wouldn't have sites crashing... When you have one supplier this is what happens.""
But whether that will help disappointed fans hoping for a glimpse of Taylor Swift in concert shake it off is another question entirely. "
business	Isle of Man businesses call for 'vital support' as costs soar	"Manx businesses need ""vital support"" from the government amid a ""cost of doing business crisis"", the Isle of Man's chamber of commerce has said.
In a open letter, the lobby group said all sectors were struggling with rising energy costs, inflation and interest rates, and needed help ""right now"".
Gas prices are to rise 43.9% next month and inflation is at a record high.
Manx government is set to reveal a package of support this week aimed at reducing the impact of rising bills.
Ahead of the announcement, several food businesses on the island have said they will have to close as a result of soaring costs.
Close Leece Farm Shop and Café in Patrick told its customers it would shut on 4 September due to ""spiralling costs and changing customer habits"" coupled the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Elsewhere, Épernay restaurant on North Quay in Douglas announced it would close for the ""foreseeable future due to current trading circumstances"".  
mber of commerce, which represents more than 500 companies on the island, said although high costs were affecting the ""whole community"", the government needed to do more to help businesses.
It has called for specific support aimed at workers who are not on benefits but face the ""same pressure on bills, but with less disposable income"", as well as a cap on shipping costs, and the provision of more affordable housing, 
wants to see a further relaxation of visa requirements and greater efforts to encourage people back into the workforce due to ""serious"" labour shortages.
Other requests include a call for a full independent review of the Isle of Man government's Living Wage after a mistake was discovered in its calculation.
mber said this came as a ""shock"" to members, and had ""fuelled unnecessary inflation"".

business	Female avatar sexually assaulted in Meta VR platform, campaigners say	"Campaigners say the avatar of a 21-year-old researcher was sexually assaulted in Meta's virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds.
Corporate accountability group SumOfUs, for whom the researcher works, says it shows Meta needs better plans to mitigate harms in the metaverse.
Meta's annual shareholder meeting takes place on Wednesday.
mpany told the BBC there were safety tools in Horizon Worlds to help people have a ""positive experience"".
Noting that Meta had not yet seen the full SumOfUs report, a spokesperson told the BBC the firm wanted everyone in Horizon Worlds to access the safety procedures ""and help us investigate and take action"".
Horizon Worlds is currently only available to users in the US and Canada. Avatars in the platform have a simplified, cartoonish appearance.
SumOfUs says that virtual assaults can be intensely traumatic.
""It still counts, it still has a real impact on users,"" the group's campaigns director Vicky Wyatt told the BBC Tech Tent podcast.
Ms Wyatt said the researcher subjected to the alleged assault felt that ""part of them was really shocked, part of them thought, 'OK, this isn't my real body, this is an avatar' and another part of them thought 'this is really, really important research that I'm doing, I need to capture this footage'"".
BBC has seen some of that footage. The avatar of the researcher is not in vision, as it is taken from her perspective, but there are two male avatars in the room, one of whom is observing while the other appears very close to her. The pair make lewd comments and share a virtual bottle of drink.
re is no single agreed definition of the metaverse, and proponents admit it is a work-in-progress.
It draws upon several different pre-existing technologies, including virtual reality and augmented reality.
metaverse is not a single space, and many different 3D virtual environments - including established games and virtual worlds - are said to be part of it. 
Of the parts of the metaverse that presently exist, only some - such as Horizon Worlds - are owned by Meta. However, the company has championed the idea, is investing billions of dollars in developing the concept and plans to hire thousands of staff to work on it.
Earlier reports of virtual assaults on avatars and inappropriate ""creepy"" behaviour prompted Meta to introduce new safeguards into its virtual worlds in February
Personal Boundary prevents avatars from coming within a set distance of each other, making it easier to avoid these unwanted interactions.
It stops others ""invading your avatar's personal space"", said Meta.
""If someone tries to enter your Personal Boundary, the system will halt their forward movement as they reach the boundary.""
According to Meta, the default Personal Boundary setting is roughly 4ft (1.2m) virtual distance between your avatar and those of anyone not on your friends list.
mpany says it also offers a number of ways to block and report users.
According to SumOfUs, the researcher was ""encouraged"" to disable the Personal Boundary feature.
researcher also witnessed homophobic slurs and virtual gun violence, the group claims.
SumOfUS has filed a resolution with a small group of shareholders, asking for a risk assessment of the human rights impacts of the metaverse to be conducted by the company. 
group also criticised a recent blog post by Meta's president of global affairs, Nick Clegg.
In it, he wrote: ""We wouldn't hold a bar manager responsible for real-time speech moderation in their bar, as if they should stand over your table, listen intently to your conversation, and silence you if they hear things they don't like."" 
Ms Wyatt says that Meta needs to act now to tackle issues: ""Rather than Facebook rushing headlong into building this metaverse, we're saying look, you need to stop look at all the harms that are happening on your platforms right now that you can't even deal with. 
""Let's not repeat and replicate those in the metaverse. We need a better plan here on how to mitigate online harms in the metaverse""."
business	Greene King brewery five-day strike ends	"A five-day strike by 188 staff working for brewery giant Greene King has ended without a resolution to a pay dispute and with more action planned.
Walk-outs took place at sites in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk; Eastwood, Notts; and Abingdon, Oxon.
Unite said union members had rejected an offer of a 3% pay rise and one-off payment of £650, and more strikes were planned for 21-23 December.
Greene King said it was ""disappointed"" its offer had been rejected.
Unite said the pay offer was a substantial real-term wage cut, because of inflation.
Unite regional officer Mark Jaina said strike action was not something the union wanted.
""Nobody wants to willingly go out on strike and stand in the freezing cold for five days, eight hours a day, but that's the situation we've been put in,"" he said.
Mr Jaina said workers were ""sympathetic to the people that like their favourite tipple, but their wages are of paramount importance"".
A Greene King spokesperson said: ""We can assure customers that this week's industrial action has not caused significant disruption and pubs across the country continue receiving deliveries from us.
""We have received notice for further industrial action from the afternoon of Wednesday, 21 December until the end of Friday, 23 December, but the large majority of our Christmas deliveries will already be completed by this point and we will ensure any disruption to customers is kept to an absolute minimum. 
""We remain disappointed that the union encouraged its members to reject our offer and we've met regularly with members of Unite over the past few months and explained how we aim to be fair and consistent across our business, given the challenging wider economic environment currently.""

business	Stamp duty cut in bid to help house buyers	"government has announced a cut to stamp duty, the tax paid when people buy a property in England and Northern Ireland. 
reshold at which the tax falls due has been raised to £250,000 from its current £125,000 level. 
Meanwhile the threshold for first-time buyers has been increased from £300,000 to £425,000. 
ges should remove 200,000 people from having to pay stamp duty, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng said.
r also increased the value of the property on which first-time buyers can claim stamp duty relief from £500,000 to £625,000.
A buyer splashing out £500,000 on a home will now be charged £12,500 rather than the previous £15,000.
""Home ownership is the most common route for people to own an asset, giving them a stake in the success of our economy and society,"" Mr Kwarteng told the Commons as he presented his mini-budget. 
""This is a permanent cut to stamp duty, effective from today."" 
Different rates apply in Scotland under the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax, and in Wales with the Land Transaction Tax.
Under the changes announced by the chancellor, anyone spending £250,000 on a property in England or Northern Ireland will avoid £2,500 in stamp duty charges as it was previously charged at 2% between £125,000 and £250,000.
Anyone other than first-time buyers spending £300,000 will now be charged £2,500, rather than the previous £5,000.
However, some first-time buyers said the increase in the stamp duty threshold would not help.
Sarah Johnson, 26, is a hairdresser in Chester who has managed to save £8,000 in five years towards buying a first home.
But the cut in stamp duty won't help her as she would not have paid any anyway. Instead she is worried it will just push up house prices even more.
""[House prices] are just crazy at the moment and I think this is just going to make them more ridiculous,"" she says.
""I'm just trying to ignore it at the moment and hoping everything will crash and the prices will go down.
""When my mum bought her first house she says it was £50,000. I wish it was like that now because I could buy a house tomorrow!""
However, London estate agent Jeremy Leaf said: ""The stamp duty cut should encourage those at the first rung of the housing ladder to take the plunge. 
He said that would be good not just for the market but for job and social mobility across the board, as well as the wider economy. 
But rising interest rates, which will mean more costly mortgages, are set to weigh on the housing market, said Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank. 
""Many buyers will find the impact of rising mortgage rates soon eclipses the benefit of a stamp duty cut, which will keep firm downwards pressure on prices next year.""  "
business	Queen's funeral: Heathrow cancels flights on Monday	"Heathrow Airport has said about 15% of its schedule will be altered on Monday during Queen Elizabeth's state funeral.
ure the skies over London fall quiet during the events, it said.
re will be flight cancellations as a result, including 100 British Airways flights and four Virgin Atlantic flights.
Separately tens of thousands of passengers are set to be affected by a French air traffic control strike on Friday.
Among the cancelled flights will be many that fly over France, not just to and from the country.
Heathrow said that all takeoffs and landings on Monday will be delayed for 15 minutes before and after the two-minute silence at the end of the funeral. 
Following that, there will be no arrivals between 13:45 BST and 14:20 BST during the procession of the hearse, and no departures between 15:03 BST and 16:45 for the ceremonial procession via the Long Walk to Windsor Castle.
Between 16:45 BST and 21:00 BST, departures will be reduced to support the committal service at St George's Chapel.
Flights will also be diverted around Windsor Castle ""to minimise noise during the private family service and interment"", it said.
In a statement, Heathrow apologised for the inconvenience but said that ""as a mark of respect, operations to and from the airport will be subject to appropriate changes in order to avoid noise disruption at certain locations at specific times on Monday"".
Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has issued guidance which means that air passengers whose flights are cancelled or badly delayed on Monday because of Heathrow's changes will not legally be entitled to financial compensation. That is because these are likely to be deemed extraordinary circumstances.
However, airlines are offering customers refunds or re-bookings.
British Airways said its cancellations were on short-haul European flights where multiple services run on the same route, and that it was adding larger aircraft where possible to help customers re-book on operating flights.
Alternatively they can choose to have a refund. No long-haul BA flights will be affected but some will be re-timed.
What next? A day-by-day guide from now to the funeral

Virgin Atlantic also apologised for the inconvenience. A spokesperson said passengers on the affected flights, between Los Angeles, San Francisco and Heathrow, would be rebooked on alternative same-day services wherever possible, or could rebook for later dates, take a voucher or request a refund.
It said the airport and airlines were working closely with the air navigation service provider NATS to minimise the impact of these restrictions on passengers.
A Heathrow spokesperson added that extra staff would be on hand in terminals to support passengers, and that people were encouraged to travel on public transport instead of by car, because roads around the airport would be extremely busy. 
Other changes at Heathrow during the period of national mourning include observing the National Moment of Reflection with a one-minute silence at 20:00 on Sunday, showing the Queen's funeral on screens at the airport on Monday, and closing non-essential shops.
Shops deemed ""essential"", such as WH Smith, Boots and Travelex, will remain open along with restaurants, cafes and pubs.
Separately, tens of thousands of passengers are set be affected by a French air traffic control strike on Friday.
Ryanair has cancelled 420 flights, most of which were scheduled to fly over France, affecting 80,000 passengers.
EasyJet is cancelling 76 flights, British Airways will cancel 22, while Air France said it would only run 45% of its short-haul flights.
SNCTA air traffic control union said the walkout was over wages, as inflation soars, and recruitment.
Ryanair said all passengers affected had been notified this morning. The low-cost carrier normally operates more than 3,000 flights per day.
Neal McMahon, Ryanair operations director, said it was ""inexplicable"" that thousands of European citizens and visitors ""will have their travel plans unfairly disrupted"".
""It is inexcusable that passengers who are not even flying to or from France are disrupted,"" he said.
He said French laws protect French domestic flights, but not ones flying over the country.
""It is time that the European Union step in and protect overflights so that European passengers are not repeatedly held to ransom by a tiny French air traffic control union,"" he said.
Ryanair called for other European air traffic controllers to be allowed to manage flights over France to ease the impact.
Budget rival EasyJet said it had cancelled flights at the request of French authorities.
EasyJet said: ""While this is outside of our control, we would like to apologise to our customers for any inconvenience they may experience.""
British Airways will cancel 22 flights - or 11 return - to and from Heathrow, including some which fly over France. It also said there could be some extra delays on the day.
Air France KLM said the French civil aviation authority - DGAC - had asked airlines to cut their Friday schedules from all French airports by 50%.
Air France said it would only run 45% of its short and medium-haul flights, and 90% of long-haul. It also warned delays and last minute cancellations could not be ruled out.
flight cuts affect the whole of France, the DGAC said, adding that it was currently working with the European air travel regulator Eurocontrol to help airlines avoid the country's air space.
Strikes across the aviation industry caused severe disruption to Europe's summer traffic, including ground and cabin personnel, who sought pay rises to cope with increased living costs amid high inflation.
In July, several strikes by firefighters and staff at Paris' Charles De Gaulle airport led to cancellations and delays."
business	Feltwell Farm eviction 'heartbreaking' say tenants	"f 11 houses on a farm recently bought by a food company are being evicted from their properties. 
useholds at Feltwell Farm, in west Norfolk, have been told, by their new landlord Cranswick Country Foods, to leave by 16 October. 
One tenant said the order, which gave them the legal minimum of two months' notice, was ""heartbreaking"".
Cranswick said it was acting within the law and was engaging with the affected tenants.
families had been renting from a previous landowner who was understood to have sold the properties earlier this year, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Nick Baker has lived in one of the properties for about five years and said the eviction order was ""just not fair for anyone"".
His fiancee Stacey died two years ago, leaving him as a single father of two boys.
""To then have this eviction, both boys are really upset, as am I,"" he said.
""We've put a lot of work into the garden. It's a work in progress, but we'd planted a lot of flowerbeds for their mum. It's really heartbreaking.""
Ryan Baez, who has rented his home for seven years, said: ""They just expect us to up and go without any financial backing from themselves - and all the money that we've put into our property, we've just got to leave it all there.""
He also said it would be a ""massive change"" for his family and could result in the upheaval of having to find new schools for his children.
In a statement, a Cranswick spokeswoman said the company took the matter ""very seriously"".
""We appreciate this is a difficult time for those concerned and are engaging with them,"" she said.
""Any action taken has been done in accordance with due legal process and within the terms of our contractual agreements.""
King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council said that it had been contacted by some of the families and was supporting them.

""Investors are urged to be wary of the potential high risks"" associated with so-called ""virtual asset arrangements,"" the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said in a statement.
uncement comes at a tumultuous time for the cryptocurrency market.
week the founder of failed crypto exchange FTX was arrested and charged.
""Whilst some VA [virtual asset] Arrangements are commonly labelled or marketed as 'deposits' or 'savings' products, they are not regulated and are not the same as bank deposits.  Investors are not afforded with any form of protection,"" the SFC said.
""If they cannot fully understand them and bear the potential significant or total losses, they should not make an investment,"" it added.

Within hours US authorities charged him with ""one of the biggest financial frauds in US history"".
former FTX chief executive built a ""house of cards on a foundation of deception,"" Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler said.
Later on Tuesday Mr Bankman-Fried was denied bail by a judge in the Bahamas.

business	After the FTX chaos, is crypto down and out after a torrid 2022?	"If Bitcoin was a boxer it would be a scrappy brawler that refuses to give up.
But the last few weeks it has taken a pummelling, with the collapse of industry giant FTX and the arrest of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried in the Caribbean.
Bitcoin is used to taking knocks, but this anti-establishment fighter was already on the ropes after its most bruising year yet.
If Bitcoin was a boxer it would be lying on its back on the canvas seeing stars. 
It is down, but is it out? 
Bitcoin has a cracking underdog story that befits a Rocky-style boxing tale. 
Starting on the mean lawless streets of internet forums in 2009 it was just a featherweight prospect.
Yes there was a spark of promise but only a noisy niche of fans were true believers and it was worth next to nothing - a few pennies at first. 
Over the years its band of promoters swelled though, helping develop Bitcoin and fight against the establishment. 
Bitcoin's value rose to thousands of dollars and it started being recognised and welcomed in certain places. It started to be accepted on specialist websites or in trendy cafes. 
Slowly, against all the odds, Bitcoin became sought after - like a prize fighter. 
usands of imitators like Ethereum, Dogecoin and Litecoin emerged too, before in 2021 Bitcoin hit the big time, achieving extraordinary fame and fortune. 
People were throwing money at it and all other cryptocurrencies and one coin cost nearly $70,000 (£57,200).
ment too was falling over itself to invest in Bitcoin and crypto projects. 
But then, in November that year, Bitcoin started taking losses and it has kept on getting worse, with continuing knocks and scandals leaving it at its lowest point for years in value, trust and excitement. 
""This is a terrible time for the crypto space and we may see even worse days to come after the recent FTX scandal. It is a watershed moment for crypto,"" says Stefen Deleveaux, president of the Caribbean Blockchain Alliance.
FTX's collapse last month has been the biggest shock to crypto in years. It was the world's second largest exchange - the entry point for millions of people to get into crypto. 
It was seen as one of the most trusted platforms, but collapsed into bankruptcy in days after its finances were revealed to be unstable. 
FTX's founder Sam Bankman-Fried is now in custody, accused by the US of building ""a house of cards on a foundation of deception, while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto"".
Mr Bankman-Fried told the BBC he hoped he had not killed crypto.
FTX has undoubtedly dealt a knockdown blow. But 2022 has repeatedly pummelled crypto. 
""We've never seen anything like this before in cryptocurrencies,"" says Prof Carol Alexander, from the University of Sussex Business School. She predicted last year that crypto would crash in 2022, but admits she has been surprised by the frequency of events. 
first major blow came in May with the sudden collapse of two popular digital coins that caused $400bn to be wiped from the value of Bitcoin and the crypto ecosystem.
Do Kwon, the founder of the two Terra coins, is now wanted by South Korean authorities, which accuse him of hiding in Serbia.
Numerous other smaller scandals have rocked trust in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, like Kim Kardashian being fined $1.26m for promoting an ill-fated crypto coin. 
re has also been the collapse of the previously booming Non Fungible Token market with NFTs that formerly fetched millions now struggling to sell.
Massive hacks on crypto companies have also knocked confidence, with the largest seeing hackers steal $600m from the Ronin Network.
With the value of Bitcoin and all other currencies sinking, large crypto companies like Celsius, Three Arrows Capital and BlockFi have gone bankrupt, leaving investors large and small out of pocket and police investigating what happened.
rice of one Bitcoin, often seen as a barometer for how the whole ecosystem is doing, is now hovering at less than $18,000 - a 70% fall from its November 2021 peak. 
fall of the FTX exchange and others leaves a huge hole in the industry and there are jitters about others. 
On Tuesday, more than $1.4bn was withdrawn from Binance, seemingly as a result of negative crypto headlines. The company's chief executive Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao urged calm on Twitter saying it was ""business as usual"".
But Andy Renshaw, senior vice-president of product management at Feedzai, said crypto relies on having a strong and diverse pool of exchanges in order to survive this ongoing fight.
""Without a credible and trusted place to exchange safely, crypto is unlikely to return to title-fight status, never mind belt holder - at a minimum the fundamentals need to be fixed in training camp.""
Digital coins are of course only one part of the crypto ecosystem, but most estimates are downbeat on their value rising any time soon. 
Prof Omid Malekan, of Columbia Business School, says things are looking bleak for crypto as a speculative asset. ""Prices are down and many of the biggest investment-related service providers have blown up.""
But he says, crypto remains first and foremost a technology, and in that regard he says, ""It is doing just fine, in some ways better than ever.""
Prof Malekan says the the adoption of both Bitcoin, and so-called stablecoins, in developing countries with no reliable financial infrastructure shows the technology is improving lives. 
Mr Deleveaux also argues that the violent booms and busts in crypto belies its overall progress. He points to how crypto is being used by charities to get funds to places where normal money cannot reach because of conflict or repression. 
He also argues that the latest scandals are ""a chance to purge the scammers and grifters"" out of crypto.
""Crypto is just basically a very short word for the future of the digital global economy,"" says Prof Alexander, citing the use of crypto technology in the building of metaverse environments which some think will be the future of work and life."
business	Ryanair warns flight prices to Europe will rise this summer	"Plane ticket prices will rise this summer due to high demand for European beach holidays, Ryanair has said.
Airline boss Michael O'Leary said he expects prices for flights to rise by a ""high single-digit per cent"".
He said the airline's lower fares were currently driving an increase in passenger numbers, helping the company's recovery from the pandemic.
He said he hoped the airline would return to ""reasonable profitability"" in its current financial year.
firm reported annual losses of €355m (£302m) on Monday, saying its recovery from Covid restrictions being lifted had been impacted by the Omicron variant and the war in Ukraine.
flict in Ukraine has driven up global oil prices with concerns supplies from Russia, a major exporter of fossil fuels and jet fuel, could be disrupted.
group's loss for the year to 31 March was smaller than expected and narrowed from the €1.02bn (£867m) losses seen the previous year.
Mr O'Leary said he expected prices to be lower up to June compared to pre-pandemic levels, but added ""based on about 50% of all bookings, we expect prices will be up high single-digit per cent"" over the Summer.
""It seems to us that there will be higher prices into that peak summer period because there's so much demand for the beaches of Europe and those price rises going to continue,"" told the BBC's Today programme.
""I think prices will be low next winter. But it's too early to say, there's clearly going to be an economic downturn, there's some fear of recession and in a recession the lowest-cost provider, which in the UK and in Europe is Ryanair, will do better, but will do better because we can sustain lower prices.""
In its results the airline stated customers were still booking their trips later than usual and said the ""booking curve"" looked more like pre-Covid times.
Ryanair said traffic recovered strongly as it carried 97.1 million guests, up from just 27.5 million the year before thanks to the lifting of pandemic restrictions.
It said it hopes to boost this further to 165 million passengers this year - ahead of the 149 million record level seen pre-Covid.
Elsewhere, Holiday giant Tui has said it expects summer bookings to ""almost reach"" 2019 levels this year, but warned there will be ""no last minute"" deals.
""There will be practically no last minute offers at low prices this summer,"" said Fritz Joussen, Tui's chief executive.
Mr O'Leary said he hoped to see ""pinch points"" at UK airports such as Manchester or Heathrow eliminated by the end of June in time for the peak summer period. 
He said: ""There's no doubt I think getting through airports this summer is going to be challenging and we're encouraging all of our customers to show up earlier and allow more time to get through airport security"". 
However he claimed this was less the case at other airports Ryanair uses, such as Glasgow, Stansted, and Bristol.
He said Ryanair didn't face the same recruitment challenges as some competitors because it had kept people on. 
Ryanair asked staff to take pay cuts during the pandemic to avoid job losses."
business	Eurozone interest rates set to rise for first time in 11 years	"European Central Bank (ECB) has said it intends to raise interest rates for the first time in more than 11 years next month as it tries to control soaring inflation in the eurozone.
ECB said it would raise its key interest rates by 0.25% in July, with further increases planned for later in the year.
k also intends to end its bond-buying stimulus programme on 1 July.
urozone inflation estimate was 8.1%, well above the ECB's target.
""High inflation is a major challenge for all of us. The [ECB] governing council will make sure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term,"" the ECB said in a statement.
""It is not just a step, it is a journey,""  ECB President Christine Lagarde said of the moves.
ECB's main policy interest rate is currently at -0.50% and it could be back at zero or above by the end of September, the bank said. The last time it raised interest rates in the eurozone was in 2011.
Inflation in May ""again rose significantly"" as energy and food prices surged, it added.
But it said inflationary pressures had ""broadened and intensified, with prices for many goods and services increasing strongly"".
As a result, the bank has upped its estimate for annual inflation this year to 6.8%, before slowing to 3.5% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024.
ECB also cut its growth forecast for the eurozone from 3.7% to 2.8% for 2022, and from 2.8% to 2.1% for 2023.
Several other central banks have already started raising interest rates as they try to slow inflation that has been accelerating amid surging energy costs.
In the US, the Federal Reserve has now raised rates twice this year, while a series of moves by the Bank of England has now lifted UK rates to 1% - the highest level for 13 years.
Speaking at a news conference after the ECB's decision, the bank's president, Christine Lagarde, said inflation would remain ""undesirably elevated for some time"".
Energy prices are up nearly 40% from a year earlier, she said, while food prices rose 7.5% in May, partly due to the impact of the war in Ukraine on food supplies.
""Do we expect that the July interest rate hike will have an immediate impact on inflation? The answer is no,"" she said.
Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said: ""With this inflation outlook and the unavoidable path for higher rates, the ECB is facing stagflation threats full-frontal.
""The strangling hold of desperately high living costs means that euro area growth will slow through the second half of this year, with recession increasingly likely - particularly now with sharp policy tightening in the near-term horizon."""
business	Kwarteng splurge meets unintended consequences	"Liz Truss wowed the Tory membership over the summer with a promise to cut tax and take on the ""abacus economics"" of the Treasury. 
us, as they've known since ancient times, is a useful tool for calculating numbers. But to the new prime minister, the idea that things should have to add up is one for the economic policy museum.
So out went the orthodoxy, joined in the Whitehall skip by the top mandarin at the Treasury, Sir Tom Scholar. And in came Kwasi Kwarteng, a chancellor with a mini-budget that's had a maxi impact cutting tax, with a special emphasis on helping the highest earners and the most profitable companies.
What was missing was the other side of the ledger. If there are not to be spending cuts on the same spectacular scale - and we're told last year's spending review will not be revisited - there will have to be borrowing. Lots of it.
How much? We don't know, because the Office for Budget Responsibility was told not to publish any estimates based on the new tax, spend and borrowing decisions - at least for now.
What we did get was the Treasury's estimate of how much borrowing might be required if it is successful in using tax cuts to boost growth.
re's a catch there. Only Kwasi Kwarteng and his political fan club believe those growth rates are going to be achieved. Liz Truss probably thinks so too, because she put her name to an article about it for the Mail on Sunday. But since then, she's been oddly low key, to the point of being invisible. 
Others tend to think the unintended consequences of the mini-budget will counteract any advantage to growth from taxpayers getting some money back next year, with which to boost spending.
unintended consequences stem from a brief departure from the low-tax, high growth message in the prime minister's article: ""Our pursuit of growth will be reinforced by a responsible approach to the public finances,"" she said. ""We will set out our approach more fully in due course, including how we plan to get our national debt down over the medium term.""
""due course"" has not run as expected. On Friday, financial markets were already giving the prime minister the thumbs down. Re-opening on Asia on Monday morning, they took the pound down to record lows against the US dollar. Sterling recovered a tad, but it remains weak and precariously close to the psychological tripwire of parity with the dollar.
US dollar has been strengthening against other currencies, as the safe haven when the economic storm clouds are gathering. And they are gathering.  
OECD developed nations economic club issued a very downbeat assessment of the world economy on Monday, blaming most of it on Russia, and flagging up further concerns about the Chinese property bubble.
Among other things, the report said: ""Fiscal support can help cushion the impact of high energy costs on households and companies, but should be concentrated on aiding the most vulnerable and preserve incentives to reduce energy consumption.""
""Fiscal actions to cushion living standards must avoid persistent stimulus at a time of high inflation. Means-tested transfers to households broadly meet this criteria.""
All those conditions are the precise opposite of what the new Liz Truss administration had chosen to do. Its measures to mitigate energy price rises - indiscriminately fired at all businesses and households at much higher cost than similar countries - not only mask the incentive to cut energy demand. They also add fuel to the inflationary fire following the tax-cutting mini-budget. All at just the wrong moment for the global economy.
International Monetary Fund (IMF) offered its commentary along similar lines, on Tuesday evening, UK-time. Not usually given to such strong criticism, at least of developed economies, its choice to become involved implied that Britain could be a problem for precarious financial markets more widely, and could carry the risk of contagion.
IMF used to be seen as the global force for neo-liberal privatisation and de-regulation, yet it told Britain that the inequality in its choice of fiscal measures is not just a social problem but an economic one.
Moody's, one of the big three credit ratings agencies, joined in the criticism with similar stinging comment, as have financial commentators in Britain and around the world. There is incredulity about the mini-budget's lack of any discernible fiscal discipline to reassure investors that there is a limit to this borrowing splurge.
ry people you might expect to cheer a tax cut to boost growth - which includes removing the cap on financial sector bonuses - are among the most scathing.
reography of statements from the Bank of England and from the UK government, with further comment from central bank officials, suggest Treasury ministers have been put in an arm-lock. They emphasised that their dash for growth must be sustainable (in an economic sense at least), and that markets can be reassured that they will get an independent assessment of what this means for growth, inflation and borrowing from the Office for Budget Responsibility.
ge was secured from the Treasury on Monday, promising that fiscal plans will be set out on 23 November - nearly two months away.
Markets usually aren't that patient. Wednesday brought a private warning from the insurance industry that it faces solvency difficulties from having insured others against rising interest rates. That's why the Bank of England plunged into the market, to buy long-dated UK government bonds, thus helping to push down interest rates.
It might help to explain, so here goes.
UK borrows by selling bonds to institutional investors, including banks, who pay with the money we then use for public services and so on.
('gilts' because the Bank of England used to issue them with a gold edging) are a promise to deliver a coupon, or an interest payment each year, and they run for a set number of years, which differs from one bond issue to the next.
re are more than two trillion pounds-worth of such promises out there, and once issued, they are traded. If they are attractive to enough investors, as with any commodity, more demand means the price goes up. When that happens, the yield, or interest payment, becomes less valuable relative to the price being paid. That means interest rates automatically fall.
And vice versa. If investors don't like the look of UK government bonds, they sell them. If enough traders do so, that lowers the price, and the interest rate on that bond automatically goes up.
's what we've seen happening. UK government bonds have been dumped, so the price goes down and interest rates up. It meant that pension funds, holding a lot of these bonds, were seeing the value of their portfolios fall rapidly, pushing them into serious difficulties. 
With that growing systemic risk, the Bank of England has stepped in to buy a lot of UK government bonds to raise the price and lower the interest rate on them. It's doing so at an urgent pace, through to 14 October, and will be carried out ""on whatever scale is necessary"". 
And if you're finding this a bit confusing, you're not alone. The central bank's announcement sent the value of the pound sharply up, very briefly, before going sharply down.
Getting stuck into bond-buying has already taken the interest rate on a 30-year government bond from 5% interest to around 4%. And that feeds through the wholesale market to the mortgage lenders, who are seeking to price the cost of money before they commit to lending.
Many of them have temporarily withdrawn from the market, to await developments, but with the certainty that when they will return, their interest rates will be higher. 
And while these may look similar to the rates being paid before the 2008 financial crash - since when, interest rates have been exceptionally low - the gearing of loans has changed a lot.
Property prices have risen faster than incomes, the ratio of loan-to-income is also up, so servicing a bigger mortgage than in past decades at even 4 or 5% feels like a much heavier burden than it used to do. 
Will it affect the housing market? Certainly. But we don't yet know how. It's a reasonable bet that recent rapid inflation in the price of a home will at least slow up. Some lenders are war-gaming a significant fall in prices.
's the story so far. There's lots of it still to go. The price to Britain's economic credibility won't become clear for some time. And there's the fall-out politically for a prime minister and chancellor whose term in office looks to have started very, very badly."
business	Philippines lottery: Questions raised as hundreds win jackpot	"A lottery in the Philippines that saw 433 people hit the jackpot has drawn surprise and triggered scrutiny.
It was the highest number of people to have ever won the Grand Lotto's top prize, according to local media.
winning combination for last weekend's 236m peso ($4m; £3.5m) jackpot was a series of numbers which were all multiples of nine.
Philippines senate minority leader Koko Pimentel has called for an inquiry into the ""suspicious"" results.
Participants in the Grand Lotto select six numbers from one to 55. To win the jackpot, all six of a player's numbers have to match those drawn by the lottery's operator.
""These lotto games are authorised by the Republic of the Philippines. Therefore, we need to maintain and protect the integrity of these gambling games,"" Mr Pimentel said as he called for an investigation into the lottery's unusual outcome.
On Sunday, Melquiades Robles, general manager of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO), sought to reassure the public and said the drawing of winning numbers cannot be rigged.
PCSO also highlighted that people in the Philippines tended to bet on number sequences.
""Many have held on to their numbers. It's not only good to be loyal to your wives and husbands, it's also good to be loyal to your numbers,"" Mr Robles told a news conference.
PCSO also shared photographs and videos of people collecting their prize money at its office in Mandaluyong city, close to the capital Manila.
""I've been betting on pattern nine, pattern eight, pattern seven and pattern six for many years and I'm thankful I just won,"" one winner said.
rence Tao, a maths professor from University of California, Los Angeles told the BBC that a pattern like this being a winning series of numbers is rare ""for any single lottery"".
""But there are hundreds of lotteries every day around the world, and statistically it would not be surprising that every few decades, one of these lotteries would exhibit an unusual pattern,"" he said.
""It's similar to how in any given hand of poker it would be unlikely to draw a straight flush, but if one looks at hundreds of thousands of hands at once then it actually becomes quite likely that a straight flush would be drawn,"" he added.
It's not the first time a lottery has seen an unusual pattern or sequence of numbers drawn.
re were accusations of fraud after 20 people shared the jackpot in South Africa's national lottery in December 2020, when the numbers five, six, seven, eight, nine and 10 were drawn.
rganisers said the winners collected 5.7m rand ($370,000; £278,000) each.
Meanwhile, a Spanish TV reporter resigned live on air after she thought she'd hit the jackpot in the country's €4m ($3.9m; £3.4m) Christmas lottery.
Natalia Escudero started screaming on camera and told colleagues at public broadcaster RTVE she was ""not coming to work tomorrow"" - before later learning she had won just €5,000 ($4,349; £3,784).
And spare a thought for those whose lucky numbers came up in a lotto draw in the UK in March 2016.
More than 4,000 correctly picked five out of the six numbers - all multiples of seven - and ended up collecting just £15 each for their win.

business	UK economy faces a significant day	"It's a very significant day for the economy.
We will hear from the Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, in Parliament and this evening from the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, at the important annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC.
re are many questions arising internationally about British economic policy, especially as the Bank of England expands its emergency purchases of UK Government debt for a second day because of material risks to financial stability.
On Monday, UK government borrowing costs continued to soar close to levels seen just after the mini-budget.
means continued pressure on mortgage and business borrowing costs too. The Bank is worried about pensions funds obliged to sell UK government debts in a ""fire sale dynamic"".
fundamental issue remains the same however: markets are questioning whether the government can come up with a solution to its challenges that both adds up, and is politically viable.
While we have heard about some common global roots of the challenges of dealing with an energy shock and rising interest rates from the International Monetary Fund's new forecasts, the separate Institute for Fiscal Studies Green Budget makes for sobering reading.
Sluggish growth for five years, the highest interest rate bill for the government since 1950, the third highest government borrowing since World War Two. And the solution, if the government is to keep to its tax cut plan, will be £60bn of spending cuts. And that has to be done in less than three weeks, by Halloween.
For the third time the Bank of England has intervened to smooth things over, but it is not a solution."

media giant says it will inform its staff whether they are still employed after Elon Musk's takeover.
Employees are tweeting using the hashtag #LoveWhereYouWorked and a saluting emoji to say they are leaving.
Yash Agarwal, who worked in public policy, said it was ""the greatest privilege ever"" to work for Twitter.
In an internal email, the social media company said the cuts are ""an effort to place Twitter on a healthy path"".

Simon Balmain, a senior community manager for Twitter in the UK, told the BBC that he believed he has been laid off, because he was logged out of his work laptop and Slack messaging programme.
""Everyone got an email saying that there was going to be a large reduction in headcount, and then around an hour later, folks started getting their laptops remotely wiped and access to Slack and Gmail revoked,"" he said.
""Most UK folks are probably asleep and don't know yet. I was working mostly LA (Los Angeles) hours because of the projects I was on, so was still awake when it happened.""
Another Twitter worker said he was anxiously waiting for an email to arrive, confirming whether he still had a job.
He said he would probably stay up late to wait for the message.
""The exodus of talent from this lay-off will reshape the whole technology industry as we know it. We're all looking out for each other and the outreach of love and support has been incredible to see,"" Mr Balmain said. 
Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, suggested some senior staff were asked to make lists of employees to be cut on their teams. 
Cryptocurrency platform Binance invested in Twitter as part of Mr Musk's takeover. Earlier, Changpeng Zhao, its chief executive, said that ""a slimmer workforce would make more sense"".
Mr Zhao, who was speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, also criticised the platform for having been slow to roll out new features, given its level of staffing.
-cutting follows criticism of Twitter's efforts to raise money by proposing to charge $8 (£7) a month for a ""verified"" blue check-mark.

Many experts suggest that Mr Musk, the world's richest man, overpaid for the company, given current economic conditions and the depressed values of many tech stocks.
But Brandon Borrman, Twitter's former head of global communications, in a BBC interview, questioned how Twitter could justify asking people to pay in order to remain on an ""equal playing field"" with other users.
It is not clear how the cuts will affect the platform's operations. Mr Musk has a reputation for being ruthless when it comes to staff.
US media reports already speak of long hours spent by some staff to meet Mr Musk's demands in the aftermath of the takeover.
In May, Mr Musk said his work ethic expectations would be ""extreme"", but less than he demanded of himself.
As part of the takeover agreement, nine members of Twitter's board departed the company, leaving self-styled ""Chief Twit"" Mr Musk as the sole director.

Among those leaving were chairman Bret Taylor and chief executive Parag Agrawal.

business	Energy bills: Half of UK households face fuel poverty, EDF warns	"EDF Energy boss Philippe Commaret warns without more help households face a tough winter
Half of UK households are facing fuel poverty this winter unless the government does more to help with energy bills, EDF has warned.
Philippe Commaret, a senior executive at EDF Energy UK, said without further support, people face a ""catastrophic winter"".
Energy bills are predicted to be nearly three times higher than last winter.
A household is considered to be in fuel poverty if it has to spend 10% or more of its income on energy.
From October, all UK households will start receiving payments providing a £400 discount on their fuel bills, with eight million low-income households set to receive an additional £650.
But the Liberal Democrats, Labour and most major energy suppliers are calling for further support for households, including for the energy price cap to be frozen at current levels.
government has said no further measures will be announced before a new prime minister is in place from 5 September.
Mr Commaret, EDF Energy UK's managing director for UK customers, told the BBC the current level of support was ""much too low"" and called for additional help to be provided, including short-term help with bills and longer-term solutions such as better insulation for homes.
EDF had seen a 30% rise in calls from customers under stress and struggling to pay their bills, he said.
""All ideas to keep bills for customers flat should be considered,"" Mr Commaret said.
""Without further support from the government, more than half of UK households will likely be in fuel poverty by January.""
""By way of context, I have to mention that we face, despite the support that the government [has] already announced, a dramatic and catastrophic winter for our customer,"" he said.
Energy bosses are becoming increasingly vocal with their ideas for staving off an energy price emergency.  
Keith Anderson, the boss of Scottish Power, is going to present his £100bn plan at a meeting with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon later. 
It's a scheme that he has already run past Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who is tipped to be the next chancellor if Liz Truss is prime minister. 
So how would it work? The plan would involve the government guaranteeing loans to the energy companies, enabling them to keep bills frozen while still forking out higher prices for wholesale gas. The so-called deficit fund would be repaid through bills over the next 20 or so years.  
Energy companies want to see more action on this. They are urging members of the next government to treat the energy crisis as it did the Covid pandemic, requiring similar levels of intervention. The furlough scheme, for example, paid the wages of 11 million people and cost around £70bn.  
On Friday, the new energy price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy - will be announced.
for an average household is expected to rise to more than £3,500 from October, up from the current figure of £1,971.
Last winter, the typical bill for homes was £1,277.
A sharp rise in wholesale gas prices this week means bills are likely to rise even further next year, to as much as £4,650 from January.
On Monday the price of gas soared after Russia said it would close down a key pipeline for maintenance work. Experts fear the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which delivers Russian gas to Germany, may not reopen, making further price rises in the spring more likely.
But it is not just energy prices that are putting the squeeze on households. Overall, inflation reached 10.1% in July, pushed higher by rising food costs, especially for staples such as bread, milk, pasta and butter. Investment bank Citi predicts that inflation could pass 18% next year.
Mr Commaret said any customers concerned about their bill should contact EDF for further support.
Plans to enable households to get discounts on electricity bills if they cut use at peak times are set to be announced by the National Grid in the next two weeks.
Mr Commaret said EDF was providing additional help and advice to its 3.4 million UK customers via an app to help customers identify ways to save fuel.
For example, he said UK households could save £60 a year by switching off appliances that were not being used.
EDF, which supplies gas and electricity to UK households, is 84% owned by the French state, but will soon be fully nationalised."
business	Royal Mail says people should send Christmas post early	"Royal Mail has asked customers to post Christmas mail earlier than usual due to strike action by postal workers.
It has brought forward the final suggested date for sending second class post to 12 December from 19 December, and for first class to 16 December from 21 December.
Six days of strike action by CWU union members are due in December as part of a dispute over pay and conditions.
Royal Mail said it was trying to keep mail moving in the busy festive period.
It has also brought forward the final recommended date for sending international mail to 3 December from 10 December for places including Greece, Eastern Europe and Turkey.
Members of the CWU union are due to strike on 9, 11, 14, 15, 23 and 24 December.
Nick Landon, Royal Mail's chief commercial officer, said the CWU was ""striking at our busiest time, holding Christmas to ransom for our customers, businesses and families across the country"".
He apologised for any disruption, and said Royal Mail was asking customers to post early ""to help us deliver Christmas"".
Laura Joseph, Post Office customer experience director, warned that ""December 12 is now likely to be even busier in Post Office branches as customers race to take advantage of the cheaper [second class] postage"" and she urged people to post parcels as soon as possible.
CWU has been approached for comment.
About 115,000 CWU members are taking part in the dispute, which is partly over pay.
union says the latest Royal Mail pay offer of 9% spread over two years lags behind the pace of price rises, which is currently more than 11%.
Royal Mail's pay offer is also tied to changes to working conditions including start times and compulsory Sunday working which the CWU has described as the ""Uberisation"" of the postal service."
business	Luton Airport delivered 15 years' of growth in five years, inquiry hears	"An airport delivered 15 years' worth of growth in five years, a planning inquiry heard.
Plans to increase London Luton Airport's passenger capacity from 18 million to 19 million per year and amend noise contours were approved by Luton Borough Council in December.
rport is owned by the council's company, Luton Rising.
A public inquiry is taking place after the government said the main aspects of development should be reviewed.
rport is run by a separate private company, London Luton Airport Operations Limited, which submitted the expansion plans.
Local protest group Luton and District Association, for the Control of Aircraft Noise (LADACAN) has opposed the plans, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
Richard Wald KC, representing the group, said: ""This is an application borne of over rapid and non-mitigated increase in throughput, which delivered 15 years' growth in just five years, causing an out of balance increase in impacts.
""The passenger cap was also reached in 2019, nine full years ahead of its expiry and the achievement of a long-term reduction of noise contour areas by 2028."" 
Mr Wald said the council was ""aware and involved in the accelerated growth without taking any effective steps to enforce against known planning breaches"".
""In 2019, by the applicant's own admission, some 30 flights during the day and 13 by night were being flown during the busy summer period over and above what was properly permitted, largely by unmodernised aircraft making more noise and carbon emissions,"" he added.
Mr Wald said due to the alignment of the runway, much of the environmental impact fell on ""the towns and villages on north and west Hertfordshire, west into the Aylesbury Vale and Chilterns, and north into Huntingdonshire"".
Representing independent charity CPRE, Gethin Thomas said the plans would ""result in an increase of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases"".
""The future reductions promised from 2027 onwards are contingent on the same promise made previously, better and quieter aircraft, coupled with a long-term noise strategy,"" Mr Thomas said.
""CRPE Hertfordshire remains deeply concerned those promises wouldn't be fulfilled, and the impact on the countryside will be substantial and long lasting.""
John Steel KC, representing Luton Borough Council, said acoustic consultant concluded ""there'd be no material adverse impact caused by the proposed increase in passengers to 19 million"".
He said there was no national policy that ""proposes a cap on or no growth of airports"".
""The opposite is true. Growth would be supported where justified,"" Mr Steel said.

business	KitKat maker Nestle puts up prices again	"KitKat maker Nestle has put up its prices again due to ""unprecedented"" increases in costs. 
Swiss food giant said it had increased prices by 6.5% in the first half of this year. 
McDonald's and Coca-Cola also announced price rises this week. 
Companies are facing increased costs for things such as fuel, wages and ingredients, and consumer prices in the UK are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years.
Nestle, which also makes Cheerios and Smarties, had already increased prices by 3.1% in the last three months of 2021. 
Chief executive Mark Schneider said price increases were implemented ""in a responsible manner"". 
""We limited the impact of unprecedented inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints on our margin development through disciplined cost control and operational efficiencies,"" he added. 
Price rises were highest in North America, at 9.8%, compared with 4.9% in Europe. 
Nestle said organic sales - which strip out the impact of currency changes and acquisitions - had risen by 8.1% in the first half of the year. The firm raised its organic sales growth forecast for the year to between 7% and 8%.
Net profit fell by 11.7% to 5.2bn Swiss francs ($5.4bn; £4.5bn) as a result of one-off items, including higher taxesand write-offs of property and equipment in Russia. 
In March, Nestle stopped investment in Russia and pulled its popular brands out of the country following the invasion of Ukraine. However, it still sells essentials such as baby formula and medical nutrition products there. 
war in Ukraine has helped to push up the cost of fuel and food further, with UK inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hitting 9.4% in June, the highest level for more than 40 years. 
Some firms are also having to increase wages to attract and retain staff, with job vacancies at near record highs. However, pay increases are not keeping up with the growing cost of living. 
On Wednesday, McDonald's said it was increasing the price of its cheeseburger for the first time in more than 14 years - from 99p to £1.19 in the UK . 
It came after drinks giant Coca-Cola told Bloomberg its global prices had increased by an average of about 5% 
Earlier this week, Amazon also announced it was increasing prices for UK customers due to higher costs, with the price of its Prime subscription service rising by £1 a month from September."
entertainment	English National Opera fights 'absurd' plan to relocate to Manchester	"English National Opera's boss has dismissed a plan to move out of London and slash its funding as ""not doable"".
On Friday, Arts Council England said it would axe the company's entire £12.6m annual grant from 2023, instead giving it £17m over three years - but only if it relocates, possibly to Manchester.
On Wednesday, the ENO's Stuart Murphy said: ""I think we're going to be saying to the secretary of state tomorrow and to the Arts Council, 'We can definitely do levelling up, but that can only happen with a big London base.'""
He described the Arts Council's plan - which he only learned about a day before the announcement - as ""absurd"" and ""insane"".
restigious company is now campaigning for the decision to be reversed, and is supporting a petition set up by opera singer Sir Bryn Terfel, which has more than 16,000 signatures.
Mr Murphy said he initially thought a move could be viable. ""We then looked at the money over the weekend,"" he told BBC News.
""We spoke to people that the Arts Council hadn't bothered to speak to in Manchester, from across the opera world, and our staff - and it's just not doable.""
One reason is because opera employs people with specialist skills, both on stage and behind the scenes, he said.
""These are skills that can't just be learned in the three years we've been given. These are people who've been in the company for 40 years. It takes a long time to train to be an opera singer. We can't just close down in one area and start in another.""
Also, opera ""requires fundraising on a pretty big scale"", and Manchester has fewer sources of money - some of which have already been tapped by Opera North, which currently tours to Salford.
""So straight away you've got a situation which is really hard, to pull up the really deep roots of an opera company and just transport it,"" Mr Murphy said.
He claimed the Arts Council had not sounded out Leeds-based Opera North, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, or the new home he said ACE had earmarked for the ENO - Manchester's £210m new arts venue, Factory International.
""This came as a complete surprise to them. It came as a massive surprise to us because our report card from the Arts Council says we're doing an amazing job,"" Mr Murphy said.
""It reminds us that one in seven of our audience are under 35, that a fifth of our singers are ethnically diverse, that our average ticket price is a quarter of that of a normal opera house and we give free tickets to under-21s.
""And we do these amazing things like ENO Breathe with the NHS that happen right across the country. So we've kind of done everything that was asked of us and more, even by the Arts Council's admission.
""So to just put in place a funding suggestion, which is half our funding level, 200 miles away, to happen in 20 weeks, is absurd.""
Mr Murphy, who recently announced his departure as ENO chief executive, called on the Arts Council to carry out a strategic review of opera provision across the country.
He warned: ""If they're not careful, they're going to dismantle an arts organisation that's been in existence for almost 100 years and is seen as a beacon for progressive work that's broken down preconceptions of opera.""
ENO is based at the London Coliseum in the West End and is one of two major opera companies in the capital, along with the Royal Opera.
grant delivered by the Arts Council, using government money, accounts for around a third of its annual income.
mpany took the headlines in a wider redistribution of arts funding after the Arts Council was told by the government to move millions of pounds outside the capital.
Arts Council has said the ENO will not receive any funding after April 2023 if it does not relocate.
A spokesperson said: ""We require English National Opera to relocate the core of their work to another part of England if they wish to continue to receive regular public funding from us.
""We raised Manchester as an option and English National Opera initially received that idea positively. English National Opera's future is in their hands - at this early stage we have announced our funding plans for the next three years, and now we hope to engage in detailed planning with them.
""This would involve English National Opera reshaping their business model and finding a suitable location outside of London.""
ENO's bosses could face the decision of whether to move out of London and keep some public funding, or stay in the capital as a privately-funded operation.
""There definitely could be a private opera house in London. There's lots in the south-east already,"" said Mr Murphy, adding that the ticket prices would inevitably increase.
""Straight away you're talking £300-350 for your most expensive ticket. That is not what brings on new work, brings on talent, brings on the next generation.
""It over-caters to the same rich metropolitan middle class audience, and that's why opera is dying as an artform.""
Manchester's Factory International said it had not been contacted by the ENO, and that the Arts Council had not suggested the ENO would move into its new building. 
A spokeswoman said: ""We would of course be enthusiastic to collaborate with ENO on appropriate projects that fitted both organisations' goals - which in our case would be on new works, not the traditional opera repertoire."""
entertainment	Morecambe and Wise 'Monty Python' UEA interview sparks further find	"Morecambe and Wise call Monty Python 'boring' in a TV interview clip unearthed in 2021
A long-lost Morecambe and Wise interview has been found almost in its entirety after a clip hit the headlines last year - prompting the rediscovery.
medy double act told how they were ""bored stiff"" by Monty Python in an old university TV station interview, in a two-minute clip unearthed in 2021.
A restoration expert spotted the story and remembered having the tape, leading to the longer interview being found.
Film professor Melanie Williams said it was ""so important to preserve"" it.
gendary duo were filmed speaking to the University of East Anglia's (UEA) student TV station Nexus after a performance at Norwich's Theatre Royal in November 1973. 
r bruising take on cult comics Monty Python was revealed, with Eric Morecambe saying the ensemble performed ""university comedy... and I'm afraid that a lot of it is very unprofessional"".
However, this latest find featured most of the seven-minute interview, with just the opening seconds missing. 
Morecambe and Wise appeared in a playful mood, but revealed how they felt ""modern"" performers had it too easy reaching the top.
""I think they've reasonably got it made today,"" said Wise. 
""A lot of people are stars and they shouldn't really be stars. They've been accelerated into it.""
""To start is probably more difficult, but once you're on the way it's easier,"" said Morecambe. 
""There's more money to be earned now. You work clubs nowadays with salaries that the tops of the bills used to be getting when we were youngsters.""
Monty Python clip was discovered last year by former station member Paul Hayes, now a BBC radio producer, when he digitised a duplicate copy he had made from an original VHS compilation tape kept in Nexus' studio.
""When I was a student at the UEA in the early 2000s there was a cupboard full of these old Sony reel-to-reel videotapes from the 1970s in the studio,"" he said. 
""One of them was labelled as having a 'famous Nexus in-depth interview' with Morecambe and Wise on it, but we didn't have anything to play it on.""
In 2004, Mr Hayes sent the tape to the BBC but it was unable to be viewed, so they passed it on to restoration specialist Peter Crocker, who was also unable to salvage any material. 
""Peter hung on to the tape all these years and got in touch with me when the story about their Monty Python criticisms made the news, as it had reminded him that he still had it,"" said Mr Hayes.
Mr Crocker then gave the tape to another specialist David Palfreyman, who runs a specialist film and videotape restoration business, and he managed to play the old format after - bizarrely - baking the tape in his oven.
""After a while tapes tend to get sticky,"" said Mr Palfreyman. 
""Once they get sticky, they start to lose their magnetic strip, and if you start to play it chances are the magnetic strip of the tape is just going to fall off. 
""But if you bake it for a certain length of time it kind of resets everything and dries it out.""
However, the other challenge is trying to find the right machine - which is rarely available second-hand and then it often needs refurbishing before it will work to play obsolete formats. 
Interestingly, the full tape - that ran for almost 40 minutes - also contained an interview with famous French mime artist Marcel Marceau, who appeared at the Norfolk and Norwich Festival in October 1973 but without any of his props after they got lost in transit.
Prof Williams, a lecturer in film and television studies at the UEA, said it was important to preserve such rare material.
""There's stuff that you get from it that you don't see in other kinds of interviews,"" she said.
""It's the perfect justification for why it's important to preserve this kind of material. 
""It is rough around the edges in certain ways, but it enables them to do things that other kinds of media can't do, and I think it's so important to preserve those different perspectives that this kind of media can provide.""
Colin Webb, who was then a 25-year-old mature student at the UEA, carried out the interview and was happy it was now available to view again after nearly half a century.
""It just reminds you what delightful people they were, really,"" he said.
""Totally human and funny and relaxed, and surprisingly very willing to give their time to our university TV.""
Speaking last year, Monty Python member Sir Michael Palin said he was ""a little hurt"", but ""intrigued"" having seen the footage.

entertainment	H&M: Justin Bieber collection axed after singer's 'trash' criticism	"H&M has removed a Justin Bieber-inspired collection after it was branded ""trash"" by the singer.
28-year-old said he had not approved the collection, which included T-shirts, jumpers, tote bags and phone accessories.
Posting on his Instagram Story, the Sorry singer urged people not to buy the items which he said were being sold without his permission or approval.
mpany said proper procedures were followed but have now pulled the line.
""The H&M Merch they made out of me is trash and I didn't approve it,"" Justin wrote on his Instagram story on Tuesday. ""Don't buy it. 
""I didn't approve any of the merch collection that they put up at H&M,"" he continued. 
""All without my permission and approval. I wouldn't buy it if I were you.""
In a statement, H&M defended the fashion line, which reportedly features images of the star.
""As with all other licensed products and partnerships, H&M followed proper approval procedures,"" a spokesperson for the fashion retailer said.
""But out of respect for the collaboration and Justin Bieber we have removed the garments from our stores and online.""
It's not the first time a star has hit out at a brand for using their image without permission.
In 2015, Rihanna won a court case against Topshop - she successfully sued its parent company for £3.3m after it sold a sleeveless T-shirt with her photo on it. 
And in 2019, Ariana Grande brought action against Forever 21 after she claimed it published at least 30 ""unauthorised"" images and videos that suggested she had endorsed the brand.
Justin is currently on a break from touring after he revealed he was suffering from facial paralysis, after a diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome.
Ramsay Hunt syndrome is when a shingles outbreak affects the facial nerve near someone's ears, resulting in paralysis of parts of the face.

entertainment	Hugh Jackman: Wolverine star on mental health problems	"Actor Hugh Jackman has said he was ""a hot mess"" making his latest film, The Son.
54-year-old X-Men star explained: ""I certainly realised how vulnerable I was.""
He plays a successful lawyer with a teenage son (Zen McGrath) from a previous marriage who is suffering from depression. 
Jackman told the BBC the subject matter of the film and returning to acting after not working during Covid lockdowns caused him ""anxiety"". 
And then his father died while he was making the movie.
""My father actually never missed a day of work in his life,"" Jackman says, explaining why he did not take any time off to grieve. ""I did imagine what my father would say and he would say, 'Go to work'."" 
Nonetheless, making The Son was hard and the pressure took its toll.
""I would be one of the least [likely] people I know who I'd describe as a hot mess, but I certainly was during this.""
Jackman suffered sleepless nights while playing the role of Peter, a workaholic with a new partner, young baby, an ex-wife and their troubled teenage son. The star says he continues to consult a therapist who helped him through filming. 
film's producers also employed psychiatrists on set in case members of the cast and crew needed to talk about the upsetting material. 
""This was the first time I'd ever seen such a thing on a film,"" says Jackman, ""and people used it and it was necessary.""
While intimacy coaches have become commonplace when sex scenes are being filmed, Jackman advocates mental health support as well. 
""There's a little part of the old school part of my brain [that thinks], 'Well, that's up to you to work out.' If you need to go to a doctor, for whatever reason, your foot, your mental health, you know, you work that out.
""But I think it certainly would be a sign from an employer that we understand taking care of the whole person, not just paying them, but taking care of their wellbeing in all forms is really, really important."" 
See-Saw films, which produced The Son, worked with the Film and TV Charity, which has developed a free industry-wide resource to destigmatise poor mental health in film and TV.
rity's 2021 Looking Glass survey found that nine in 10 people working in the sector had experienced a mental health problem.
Whole Picture Toolkit offers guidance and advice on supporting mental health and wellbeing on set and pre and post-production and, so far, the kit has been adopted by 35 productions. 
Jackman says he hopes The Son will spark conversations around mental health issues ""that are urgently needed"".  
He says: ""There is a real lack of knowledge and ignorance and shame around the subject and I think it's something we need to confront, really, really quickly.""
film, which explores absentee parenting and the effects of divorce on children as well as adolescent mental illness, is tough to watch. 
While The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw praised the ""beautifully composed and literate drama"", not everyone was a fan of The Son, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival and opens in the UK in February. 
Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney said it was ""a depressing film about depression, while The Times' Kevin Maher dismissed it as ""a wearily predicable slab of family values hokum.""
However, Jackman has already received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor for his role in the drama.
It comes at a moment when some are questioning the future of gendered acting categories in awards ceremonies.
Jackman says he's a ""a big fan"" of having one gender neutral acting category in which all performers compete. 
""That would be a really positive step. I don't understand why it's split into just two genders when we all know it's a much bigger spectrum.""
Acknowledging that he ""might have just shot myself in the foot"" as his own chances of winning would be halved if there was one non-binary acting category instead of separate best actor and actress categories, he adds: ""Whatever the mix is, we should maybe just break down any of those categories that end up being divisive and unnecessary."" 
If the past is anything to go by, Jackman could be in with a shout of taking home an award this season. The Son was co-written and directed by Florian Zeller, who directed the 2020 drama The Father, which earned its star Sir Anthony Hopkins his second Oscar. 
Sir Anthony, famous for his roles in The Silence of the Lambs, the Thor movies and Westworld, makes a cameo appearance in The Son.
And Jackman gives a fascinating insight into how Sir Anthony continues to work after more than six decades on screen. 
""He shot for one day. He spent six months emailing the director Florian every single day. Florian said to me, 'I got as many emails about this one scene in a movie as I did for The Father, where he is in every scene.' He takes it so seriously.""
And that meticulous approach continued on set. 
""At one point, he wanted to redo his close-up again. And I pulled Florian aside and I said: 'But what he did was so incredible.' 
""And he said: 'Oh yeah, I've got everything I need, but I think he just misses acting. He hadn't acted for 18 months. I think he just misses it, he wanted another go.'"" 
Son represents a departure for Jackman, who played Wolverine in nine blockbuster films - and is coming back for at least one more. 
He also made his name in movie musicals, including Les Misérables and The Greatest Showman and on Broadway, where he is currently starring in The Music Man. So how does he pick roles?
""I'm always looking for things that I haven't done before, that challenge me, that scare me,"" Jackman says.
""And by the way, when I did Wolverine, it always scared me, too. That's a million miles away from who I am as well."" "

Valley Rock Voices in Neath is a choir of women aged between 21 and 80.
Founder Cerys Llewellyn-Bevan has created a community for women from all backgrounds and all ages, including mothers to grandmothers.
""We are a huge melting pot of every kind of woman,"" said Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan.
Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan started the choir with 12 friends as what she described as an ""antidote"" to her son Sam's second major operation. 
Now 26, Sam has recovered well.
From the choir, a collective has formed with activities such as walking, swimming, social and fund-raising groups.
""When you become a mum your life becomes all about your children growing up, and I think a lot of women lose the ability to go out and make friends,"" said Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan.
""I needed to get out and find some joy again, and going back to my music-making seemed to be the obvious path as it had brought me much joy previously.""
53-year-old has a classical music background and had stints as head of music at various schools.

""For nine months we didn't meet,"" said Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan. 
""I honestly thought I would never put the choir back together again.

When restrictions allowed, the choir rehearsed outdoors at Neath RFC, in the rugby stands, socially distanced and groups of 15 at a time.
Bethan Comerford, from Neath, knew Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan from school and found out about the choir on Facebook.
""Up from the sofa I got - my husband said, 'what are you doing?' I said, 'I'm going to join a choir',"" said Ms Comerford.
""It was just what I needed. It's the best thing I have ever done.""
But Ms Comerford's husband died shortly after she joined. 
""It was the middle of Covid, and every night there would be food parcels delivered by people here,"" said the 54-year-old. 
""They were fantastic, and they still are. They're such a great bunch of women.""
Joining the choir has also been of major benefit for its youngest member, Imogen Fish, from Neath. 
Now 21, Ms Fish has done GCSEs, A levels and completed a university degree while with Valley Rock Voices. She is now training to become a teacher.
""When I first started I was so shy,"" she said. 
""I wouldn't speak to anybody or look at anybody. I was going through a tricky time at school. Now I'm a totally different person.""
Joan Powell - the choir's oldest member at 80 - joined on its first day.
""When you get older you don't make lifelong friends so easily, but I have,"" she said. 
""I have formed some beautiful friendships. Everybody takes care of each other. We watch each other's backs."""

Stella Stockbridge, from Aylesbury, began by redesigning an old Jordan trainer before her art went viral on social media.
19-year-old was already using social media for her business until her experiment ""blew up"" online.
""I expected them to get a lot of hate comments... but overwhelmingly people were so supportive,"" she said.
She has produced a seven-part video series showing how she went from cutting out parts of the shoe, to painting it and even adding a light up miniature lamp post.
f was already ruined, she said, and instead of it going to waste, she was inspired to create something out of it.
She said it took a week to redesign the shoe, using unconventional materials like clay, foam board and plaster, to transform it into a piece of art.
Miss Stockbridge said she also gets ideas of what to add and graffiti on the trainers from her social media followers, and dubbed the style ""sneaker sculpture"".
""The final sneaker has a little part of everyone who supported me on it and it makes it all the more special to me,"" she said. 
Her videos attract thousands of views, however one garnered more than a million, with commenters debating whether her work should be classed as graffiti or vandalism.
She said: ""I expected them to get loads of hate comments because people get quite territorial over shoes... but overwhelmingly people were so supportive.""
She said negative comments created a conversation over what qualifies as art. 
Miss Stockbridge also discovered a whole new community of supporters on TikTok, and said it felt like people ""have her back"".
Ms Stockbridge has been heavily influenced by graffiti and street art and has found that art has helped her with her own identity. 
She said: ""Graffiti as an art form is so self-expressive and you can turn the most blank wall into something so beautiful.
""When I was younger I was quite nervous and I didn't have the best sense of identity so I feel like art has really helped me with that,"" she said.

musician revealed the diagnosis in a letter read by his former bandmates as they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Saturday.
was meant to be as a reunion for the band, whose classic line-up has not played together since 2006.
r said he was ""massively disappointed"" to miss the show, and had ""bought a new guitar"" for the occasion.
Singer Simon Le Bon read Taylor's letter to the audience, which read: ""Just over four years ago I was diagnosed with stage four metastatic prostate cancer. 
""Many families have experienced the slow burn of this disease and of course we are no different; so I speak from the perspective of a family man but with profound humility to the band, the greatest fans a group could have and this exceptional accolade.""
r, who was born in Tynemouth, wrote that he was receiving ""sophisticated life-extending treatment"", but had recently suffered a ""setback,"" that prevented him travelling to Los Angeles for the ceremony.
""Although my current condition is not immediately life-threatening there is no cure,"" he added.
Formed in Birmingham, Duran Duran were one of the biggest pop bands of the 1980s, known for their lavish videos and danceable, synthesized pop singles.
were first band to be inducted at this year's Hall of Fame concert, and opened the show with a hit-packed medley that included Girls On Film, Hungry Like The Wolf and Ordinary World.
Dolly Parton, Eminem, Lionel Richie, Eurythmics, Pat Benatar, Eminem, Carly Simon, Harry Belafonte and Judas Priest were also added to the Hall of Fame roster.
Parton, whose hits include Jolene, I Will Always Love You and 9 To 5, initially rejected her nomination, saying she didn't think country music was eligible, but later relented.
""I'm a rock star now!"" she said during her acceptance speech. 
""Back when they said they were going to induct me into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I didn't really think that I'd done enough to deserve that. I didn't understand at the time. But this is a very, very special night for me.""
Afterwards, the singer performed a star-studded version of Jolene, joined by Pat Benatar, Eurythmics' singer Annie Lennox, Simon Le Bon, Brandi Carlile, and Judas Priest's Rob Halford.
Eminem was inducted by Dr Dre, who said almost everyone he knew had tried to discourage him from working with a white rapper.
But ""I knew that his gifts were undeniable,"" Dre said. ""Each of us was what the other one needed - and I was willing to bet my entire career on it.""
Eminem, real name Marshall Mathers, used his speech to namecheck the rappers who had influenced him, from pioneers Tupac, Chuck D, Outkast and Snoop Dogg to more underground names like Lord Finesse and JJ Fad.
He did so partly to highlight the Hall of Fame's lack of recognition for hip-hop (he is only the ninth rap act to be inducted alongside Run DMC, NWA, Jay-Z, LL Cool J, Biggie Smalls, Tupac Shakur, Public Enemy, Beastie Boys and Grandmaster Flash).
""Those were my rock stars, man,"" said the musician. ""And I just want to say, those are just a few of the names that I hope will be considered in the future for induction. Because without them, a lot of us wouldn't be here. I know I wouldn't.""
Eminem went on to perform his hits My Name Is, Rap God and Sing for the Moment - the latter accompanied by Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, who was sampled on the original song.
He then brought out Ed Sheeran for a live rendition of Stan.
""I'm not supposed to be here tonight,"" said Eminem following his set. ""One, I'm a rapper; two, I almost died from an overdose; and three, I really had to fight my way through… I'm a high school drop-out with a hip-hop education.""
Janet Jackson inducted her long-time collaborators, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.

""I feel like we broke through the music industry together,"" said Jackson ""They taught me so much, and I learned their lessons well.
""When I went to work on what became Control in their hometown of Minneapolis, there was pressure. We felt like we were kids in a sandbox… We talked and laughed so much that sometimes it didn't even feel like we were making a record.""
British metal band Judas Priest took the stage with estranged guitarist KK Downing, who in 2011, playing classics like You've Got Another Thing Comin', Breaking The Law and Living After Midnight.
""I'm the gay guy in the band,"" said frontman Rob Halford. 
""We call ourselves the heavy metal community, which is all-inclusive, no matter what your sexual identity is, what you look like, or what you believe in or don't believe in. Everybody's welcome.""
Eurythmics were inducted by U2's the Edge, Lionel Richie by Lenny Kravitz, and Carly Simon by Sara Bareilles.
Simon, whose two younger sisters both died in recent weeks, declined to perform, but Barailles took her place, singing Nobody Does It Better, followed by Olivia Rodrigo who delivered a strutting version of You're So Vain.

entertainment	Cardiff Castle animal wall comes alive in children's book	"What would the stone animals perched on Cardiff Castle's wall get up to if they could come alive and enjoy the city at night? 
Illustrator Jack Skivens' first children's book sees the creatures visiting some of the city's best-known landmarks before returning to their positions before sunrise. 
In Night of the Animal Wall, the vulture sits on the old Brains brewery tower waiting for passers-by to drops chips on Caroline Street, fondly known as Chippy Alley. 
r and bear stop for a game of chess at the city's pedestrianised shopping area, The Hayes.
Alexandra Gardens while the leopard spends the evening racing trains at Central Station. 
Jack, 35, said the book was inspired by both his own childhood memories of visiting the 130-year-old statues and the questions of his curious four-year-old twins.
""It was always really special and really big and exciting to go to Cardiff,"" said Jack, who grew up in nearby Caerphilly and now lives a few miles away in Pontypridd.  
""The animals on the wall always took my interest, there was always this eeriness about them - it's just such a strange collection of animals.""
He found himself wondering if the animals could be more than mere statues. 
""I had ideas when I was younger about them coming to life, I had a really active imagination,"" he said. 
""It was kind of a nice place for your mind to wander off to, thinking about those animals wandering around and kind of what they would do.""
During the Covid pandemic lockdowns he began illustrating the stone animals.
""The idea was nature was thriving in our absence without cars and what-have-you and were able to explore new territory,"" he said.  
He also spent time during lockdowns out exploring with his children. 
""It was looking at them and the way that they see things and imagine that pushed me again to [write the book],"" he said.
k will be released on 29 October, and a city-wide animal art trail based on his story is planned for the October half-term.
Funded by the City Ambition Fund, the free event will see families invited to go on an adventure across Cardiff to find the animals who have escaped from the pages of Jack's tale.
Jack will also be hosting a series of children's book readings. 
He said he had enjoyed showing his own children the landmarks depicted in his book.
""They're really excited for it, there's that experience of taking them to these places and they're actually real, watching their minds and seeing the questions they have afterwards has been really, really fun,"" he said. 
Cardiff Castle's animal wall has been delighting adults and children alike since it was installed in 1890.
mas Nicholls began carving the animals in the late 1880s, based on sketches by architect William Burges, who was employed by the 3rd Marquess of Bute.
re were originally eight animals on the wall - a pair of lions holding shields, a lioness, a polar bear, a sea lion, a wolf, an ape and a hyena, and it was situated directly in front of the castle.
In the 1920s the wall was moved to its present position west of the castle after road widening on Castle Street, and a further seven animals by sculptor Alexander Carrick were added  - the lynx, vulture, beaver, leopard, raccoon, pelican and anteater. The polar bear was also replaced by a bear.
Night of the Animal Wall art and sculpture trail will run in Cardiff from 29 October until 4 November as part of FOR Cardiff's City of Arcades week. "

entertainment	Liverpool's Eurovision arena investigates safety concerns at Jamie Webster gig	"Liverpool arena where the Eurovision Song Contest will be held next year has apologised and pledged to investigate after fans complained about safety concerns at a sold-out concert.
Some fans at the M&S Bank Arena to see Jamie Webster on Saturday reported overcrowding and poor ticket checks.
Paul Lang, from Birkenhead, said: ""It didn't feel like a safe environment.""
ue said there were reports of overcrowding but it was resolved, and appropriate ticket checks were done.
Police said they ""did attend the venue briefly"". Indie singer-songwriter Webster, who was playing his biggest home town gig, had to cut the encore from his set.
Mr Lang told BBC Radio Merseyside his tickets weren't checked, and the entrance tunnel was ""completely full"".
""The group around us when we were getting let in, I would say at least 15-20 people walked away and were just not dealing with it, and more people were coming out, getting a bit worked up, panicked about it, and just said, 'It's just not worth it for our own safety.'""
Staff were ""just standing around"" and ""didn't seem to really show any interest"", he said.
""It felt like, if we did become in a situation that we really didn't want to be in and we were in that tunnel, I don't feel like the staff would have done anything at all really.""
Another fan, Liam Kelly, also from the Wirral, said there were long queues outside the venue.
""By the time we got close to the door, the head steward told us that we weren't going to get in because it was overcrowded,"" he told Radio Merseyside. ""They were her words.
""There were people who were coming out of the gig in tears, a lot of people looking very stressed, and shouting for people to not go in. Quite a few people in the queue at that point turned around and left.""
After the head steward got into an argument, ""she kind of left and then there was this chaos at the door where everyone just started to walk in"", Mr Kelly added.
""I presented my phone to be scanned and I had all the tickets for my group on there. So the first ticket they came to was one that had already been used by somebody else. It scanned red, and the person who's got my ticket [to check it] did not care. He's just waved me in, and that was the moment that I looked around, and nobody was having their tickets checked.""
xperience of getting in was ""really horrible"", he said. ""It was the entrance way and the bar area that were absolute chaos. You couldn't move. It took ages to get through.""
Once fully inside, it was the busiest he had ever seen the arena, ""but the venue itself inside didn't feel unsafe"", he added.
In a statement, Faye Dyer, managing director of ACC Liverpool Group, which runs the arena, said: ""There were reports of overcrowding at one of the floor bars, however the crowd congestion was resolved and people were dispersed.
""Merseyside Police received a report of concern for safety at the venue just before 9.30pm and attended the venue for a short period whilst our events security dealt with the incident. The event was deemed safe to continue.
""The process for checking tickets is a rigorous one and we understand all appropriate checks were made on the night. The safety of our customers is of the utmost importance; we take any incident seriously and a detailed investigation has already begun.
""We sincerely apologise to both the artist Jamie, who was playing the biggest show of his life, and to his fans for any aspects of their experience which fell short of their expectations. We wish to thank Jamie and his promoter for their support in removing the encore to ensure the remainder of the show continued to operate safely.""
A spokesperson added: ""As safety is our number one priority and as operators of the venue, we agreed with the artist's promoter that Jamie would not perform an encore. This was not a police request.""
On Tuesday, the venue gave more details in a set of FAQs, which said its investigation would ""help us understand the issues from this event and ensure we learn from it"". 
11,000-capacity arena was named the Eurovision host venue last month, and can expect sold-out crowds when it hosts the grand final plus two semi-finals next May."
entertainment	Stormzy says the 'token black artist' trope needs to die	"Stormzy has said he has made a conscious decision to promote his black peers and predecessors, to combat prejudice in the music industry.
""I've always understood I'm the black act. Maybe the token black act,"" the superstar British rapper told DJ Trevor Nelson in a one-off BBC special.
""I want to kill that where it stands.""
's why, the star explained, he paused his historic Glastonbury Festival set to read a list of 52 rappers who influenced him.
It also prompted him to populate the video for his recent single, Mel Made Me Do It, with musicians Little Simz, Dave and Gabrielle; sports legends Usain Bolt, Ian Wright and Dina Asher-Smith; and the author Malorie Blackman.
""There's always been this stigma of, 'let one through',"" he said. ""There's one black [man], one black woman at a time. That needs to die. 
""So that's why when I get Glasto, when I do Mel Made Me Do It, it's like, 'This is us... We stand on your shoulders.' 
""I didn't just pop out of the blue and break the matrix.""
Stormzy is also supporting new generations of black talent through his Merky foundation, which offers scholarships to Cambridge University; and Merky FC, which aims to improve diversity among football managers, coaches and other behind-the-scenes roles.
45-minute BBC special saw Stormzy perform a mix of classic hits and new songs, and sit down for a candid interview with Nelson about his origins, his rise to fame and why headlining Glastonbury had calmed his inner demons.
""It gave me such a peace in terms of knowing, all right, if it all falls [apart], you've done it. Now you can walk with your head high.""
musician said the performance had given him the confidence to pursue a more soulful, spiritual direction on his new album This Is What I Mean.
He cited Stevie Wonder, Frank Ocean and Lauryn Hill among the record's influences - but reserved his highest praise for Whitney Houston, who he named the ""greatest of all time"".
""I've got a lot of GOATs, but Whitney is my GOAT GOAT,"" he said.
""If I leave here and I get in my car and I listen to Whitney, I'm thinking, you've done something that's intangible.
""You haven't put your hand on my back, you haven't shaken my hand, you haven't given me a hug - but you have just hit me in my soul.""
Stormzy also talked about his long-standing friendship with fellow Londoner Adele. 
""I'm a genuine fan,"" he told Nelson. ""She's blessed with a gift of a stunning, beautiful, moving voice and a phenomenal pen. And her ability to marry what she's gone through, her experiences, her feelings, with art and melody, is second to none.""
However, he said he had never considered asking her to appear on one of his records.
""Our friendship ain't based off [that]. That's never the conversation. 
""Anyone who does music that is my real-life friend... Adele, Ed [Sheeran], Dave, Chris Martin, it's never off that basis. I'll be fine to never make music with any of them. 
""However, if I could get a hook...!"" he joked, before adding: ""But no, I never, I never."""
entertainment	Terry Hall: Tributes to The Specials singer who was 'one of the greats'	"music world has been paying tribute to singer Terry Hall, remembering The Specials frontman as ""truly one of the greats"" who had ""a heart of gold"".
Hits like Ghost Town, Gangsters and Too Much Too Young soundtracked British life in the late 1970s and early 80s.
ributes came from UB40, Boy George and Elvis Costello, who said his voice ""was the perfect instrument for the true and necessary songs on The Specials"".
He added: ""That honesty is heard in so many of his songs in joy and sorrow.""
Costello produced The Specials' self-titled 1979 debut album.
rheaded the Two Tone and ska scenes, and were groundbreaking for their multi-racial membership and how they used pop music to reflect an era of upheaval, unemployment and racial tension.
Billy Bragg recalled: ""The Specials were a celebration of how British culture was invigorated by Caribbean immigration but the onstage demeanour of their lead singer was a reminder that they were in the serious business of challenging our perception of who we were in the late 1970s.""
Hall's friend and biographer Paul Willo told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the singer ""was the instantly recognisable voice of a generation"".
""And he was a forthright character who stood up for what he believed in. Together with the band, he was very vocal about racism and injustice in general,"" he added.
""There was so much turmoil going on in the country at that time… With the right material and the reasons to be angry, it made them more of a force and him more vocal, I suppose.""
Singer Frank Turner was born shortly after The Specials split up in 1981 but told Today their music remained relevant.
""It was talking about the fact that there are these tensions in society, there are these things that are worth being angry about, there are these divides, and there are things that we can do about them,"" Turner said.
""That was important and relevant in the early 1980s but for me as a kid, it felt important and relevant and - I don't want to say educational - when I first started listening to them.
""And I think the relevance of the music of The Specials and the words and music of Terry Hall remain completely vibrant and important today.""
raising Hall and his influence ranged from singer-songwriters to pop stars and dance acts.
Electronic duo Leftfield wrote on Twitter that Hall was ""such an amazing singer"", adding: ""He sang about real people and real issues. People I could identify with. Such a loss. A brave guy.""
Former Bros singer Matt Goss said The Specials were very important because they ""made you feel alive"" and Ghost Town was ""a masterpiece"".
""The Specials represent my youth, they represent everything about my teenage years, they were THE BAND that got us out of our homes and into the school discos & clubs!"" he wrote.
""And [they] turned us on to a trend that was an all encompassing movement of music and fashion SKA!!... The Specials gave you a sense of strength, while still allowing the sensitive side of artistry to run through your veins.""
Andy Bell of the bands Ride and Oasis also recalled the impact of The Specials' songs and look.
""At 11 I suddenly wanted a Harrington [jacket] with red tartan lining, a Fred Perry shirt, black sta prest [trousers], white socks and black loafers with tassels, all because this man's music had swept through my school like Elvis in '56,"" Bell said.
""Those 2 @the specials albums are pure genius.""
Former The Cure drummer Lol Tolhurst described seeing Hall live at two concerts - one in 1979 and another in 2022. 
""Both times Terry Hall standing stock still at the centre of the storm, a melancholy counter point to the joyous energy of the band. Bringing the idiosyncratic and ironic songs to life beautifully.""
Squeeze's Chris Difford described Hall as ""a man of few words verbally but so many great words in song"", adding: ""I always admired and envied his sweep of the pen. Take care on the steps above young man.""
Listen to more about Terry Hall on BBC Sounds
Carole Donnelly, a friend of Hall's, told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""He was kind, witty, but a very shy man. He was somebody who was so talented.
""For me he inspired you to overcome adversity and hatred... turn your back on hate and turn that into love. That was the thing that it was.
""He was a legend, and he's a legend in Coventry. It was a horrible time to be in the city but they gave us hope. I was in a mixed race relationship, the political landscape and music and lyrics gave us a voice as young people. I was 16 when I met him, he was 18, we were angry young punks. We got to love music and we brought that all together and it's inspired so many generations of people.""
Happy Mondays singer Rowetta told the station: ""He just believed in everything and really with passion. He wouldn't be singing lyrics he didn't mean with no feeling. He wrote lyrics that meant something.  
""He really cared about people as well, his politics weren't just for the sake of it, he really meant it and wanted to help the world. He really did believe in that. Love, love, love.""
Specials came from Coventry, and Dave Wakeling of ska band The Beat - from nearby Birmingham - posted a photo of the pair playing football with the message: ""Cryptic, droll, a heart of gold, and he could tackle like a donkey!
""Always a proper gent to The Beat, our condolences to family and friends.""
Proclaimers described him as ""a quite brilliant, singer, songwriter and lyricist with profound humanity"".
UB40, also from Birmingham, wrote: ""Another one gone too soon! RIP Terry.""
Dexy's Midnight Runners said they were ""very sorry and shocked to hear the sad news about the lovely, and brilliant Terry Hall"".
Other bands paying tribute included The Coral, who said: ""Thanks Terry Hall for all the music, inspiration, and being kind to us when we were starting out. So sad."" 
Specials' influence stretched across the Atlantic, with Canadian singer Ron Sexsmith remembering how he had ""been a fan of their music ever since seeing them perform Gangsters on SNL [Saturday Night Live] when I was 16"".
He added: ""It was a pretty exciting period for music and they were definitely a huge part of it."""

entertainment	James Corden and Ricky Gervais: Can you steal a joke?	"James Corden has admitted ""inadvertently"" using material by fellow comedian Ricky Gervais as part of a routine on The Late Late Show.
During a monologue about Elon Musk's Twitter takeover he made a joke strikingly similar to one Gervais made in 2018 on his show Humanity.
It was delivered, he said, ""obviously not knowing it came from him"".
Gervais later deleted a response in which he said one of Corden's writers probably ""came up with it"" for him.
While there has been the usual reaction of comments and memes on social media, one question you might be wondering is can you - legally - take someone else's joke?
Laura Trapnell from Paris Smith solicitors has told BBC Newsbeat that a joke could be protected either as a literary work, if the comedian wrote it down, or a dramatic work if it was performed.
jokes also have to be substantially alike - so what was said?
""When you see Elon Musk talk about Twitter he does this thing where he goes, 'Well, it's the town square',"" ran Corden's joke.
""But it isn't. Because if someone puts up a poster in a town square that says 'Guitar lessons available' you don't get people in the town go, 'I don't want to play the guitar'. Well that sign wasn't for you it was for somebody else, you don't have to get mad about all of it.""
Now let's compare it with the Ricky Gervais version.
""That's like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard and there's a notice - 'guitar lessons' - and you go 'but I don't want guitar lessons' - fine, it's not for you then, just walk away, don't worry about it."" 
But after being called out online, Corden said he told the joke ""obviously not knowing it came from [Gervais]"".
uld be an important distinction, according to Laura.
""The infringer is the person who affects the copying, so that may not be James Corden if, as Ricky Gervais suggests, his team wrote the joke and he merely delivered it,"" she says.
""If he had no idea that the joke was copied, then James Corden would be what's called an innocent infringer.
""This means that he's still liable for performing a copied dramatic work. It all starts to get a bit complicated. 
""The writers would be the ones in the firing line,"" Laura says.
Faizan Shah, 28, is a comedian who performs stand-up sets around Manchester, and he believes that the joke came from the Late Late Show's writers.
But he says writers often have ""added pressure"" to produce jokes quickly, which may sometimes lead to duplication.
""Sometimes you can't exactly think of something original, which is going to be unbelievably funny right off the bat,"" he says. 
""So writers end up drawing off the back of something else that you already know is funny and your work.""
In terms of whether joke stealing is ever OK, Fazian has a strong opinion: that you should never pass off another comic's work as your own. 
""It's just a massive no, no - because you're basically just trying to steal an idea,"" he says. 
""Ricky Gervais has written it, and probably performed it multiple times to work out how he wants to perform it, to then just 'I'll just have that' you're basically not showing respect to the art form,"" he adds.

entertainment	Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas is You copyright case dropped	"Singer Mariah Carey is no longer being sued for copyright infringement over her hit song All I Want for Christmas is You, after country singer Andy Stone dropped his legal action.
Songwriter Mr Stone sued the popstar in June, claiming he co-wrote a song with the same name five years earlier.
He told the court he would dismiss the case - but legally he could refile it.
A must-have on any festive playlist, Carey's mega-hit is one of the best known Christmas records of all time.
Mr Stone, who performs under the name Vince Vance with the band Vince Vance and the Valiants, previously filed the lawsuit in a New Orleans federal court - where he also filed to have the case dismissed.
He was claiming at least $20m (£16m) in damages, arguing that Carey exploited his ""popularity"" and ""style"".
Despite sharing a title, the two songs are musically different, but Mr Stone claimed that Carey did not ask for permission to use the song name and had earned ""undeserved profits"" from it. 
It is not unusual for different songs to have the same name, and the United States Copyright Office lists 177 entries on its website under the title All I Want for Christmas is You.
Since appearing on the album Merry Christmas in 1994, the song has topped the charts in several countries and by 2017 had reportedly earned Carey more than $60m (£48m) in royalties.
It has been streamed over one billion times on Spotify.
In a recent memoir, Carey admitted to composing ""most of the song on a cheap little Casio keyboard"".

minees include hotly-tipped house producer Fred Again, drum and bass duo Piri & Tommy and the Mobo-award winning jungle musician Nia Archives.
R&B girl group Flo and busker-turned-baladeer Cat Burns are also nominated.
Now in its 21st year, the Sound Of list has predicted success for the likes of Adele, Stormzy, Sam Smith and Haim.
r's longlist suggests that dance music will continue to dominate the charts next year - after club hits like LF System's Afraid To Feel and Eliza Rose's Baddest Of Them All became the soundtrack of summer 2022. 
Breakout British producer Fred Again is already a must-see live act, whose electrifying set at London's Boiler Room went viral earlier this year.
Born Fred Gibson, he's been a behind-the-scenes hitmaker for years, producing and writing hit singles for the likes of Ed Sheeran (Bad Habits), George Ezra (Shotgun), BTS (Make It Right) and Stormzy (Own It).
He struck out as a solo artist in 2020, releasing a trilogy of albums that blend house music with everyday samples and conversations recorded on his phone.
Bradford-born Nia Archives is at the forefront of the jungle music revival in the UK, whose fast-paced Forbidden Feelingz EP was praised for its ""laser-sharp"" songwriting and ""electrifying soundscapes"".
Real-life couple Piri & Tommy, meanwhile, have become known for infectious, feel-good drum and bass tracks like Beachin' and Soft Spot.
glist also features US neo-soul band Gabriels, whose debut album Angels & Queens has ""a strong claim to the title of album of the year"", according to The Guardian's Alexis Petridis.
re fronted by former American Idol contestant Jacob Lusk, who recently told BBC News his time on the TV show had been ""treacherous"" and ""harrowing"".
Nigerian star Asake is on a hot streak at home with hits like Sungba and Joha, and looks set to replicate that success in the UK, with a sold out show at London's Brixton Academy scheduled for later this month.
Cat Burns has already scored a platinum-selling single, after her break-up ballad Go went viral on TikTok earlier this year. 
22-year-old followed that up with support slots on Ed Sheeran's stadium tour, and a nomination for the Brits rising star award.
glist is completed by pop-punk singer Dylan, indie songwriter Rachel Chinouriri and alt-pop musician Biig Piig, who has been championed by Billie Eilish.
You can listen to their biggest songs and find out more about their careers to date below. 
five will be revealed in the new year on BBC Radio 1, with one artist announced each day from Sunday 1 to Thursday 5 January.
rize is open to new artists, who have yet to score a top five album, or more than two top 10 singles by 31 October 2022. Artists who have appeared on TV talent shows within the last three years are also ineligible.
Last year's poll was won by bedroom pop singer PinkPantheress, with breakout indie duo Wet Leg in second place and emotive pop singer Mimi Webb in third.

entertainment	Eurovision 2023: Liverpool beats Glasgow to be song contest host city	"Watch the moment Graham Norton announced the 2023 host city
Liverpool has been chosen to host the first Eurovision Song Contest to be held in the UK for 25 years.
me of The Beatles, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and The Wombats will stage the spectacular event on 13 May after beating off competition from Glasgow.
w is coming to the UK after this year's winner, Ukraine, was unable to take up hosting duties due to the war.
In a message to Ukraine, Liverpool's mayor said the event, at the M&S Bank Arena, would ""do you proud"".
Joanne Anderson said the city ""faced strong competition from Glasgow"" but she was ""over the moon"".
""This is a massive event and the eyes of the world will be on us in May, especially those of our friends in Ukraine,"" she said.
""Now begins months of work to put on the best party ever. Ukraine - you have my promise we will do you proud.""
Claire McColgan, director of the city council's Culture Liverpool, told BBC News: ""It feels like the whole city kind of jumped in the air at exactly the same time tonight.""
UK Prime Minister Liz Truss said Liverpool would ""put on an unforgettable show which celebrates the rich culture and creativity of Ukraine"".
Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan added: ""The city loves music and knows how to throw a party, so I've no doubt it will host a spectacular experience for the thousands in attendance and millions watching at home on the BBC.""
Merseyside pop star Sonia, who came second for the UK at Eurovision in 1993, agreed. She told the BBC's One Show: ""Scousers know how to party and we're going to have the biggest party ever.""
Some fans watched the announcement on screens at Liverpool's famous Masquerade drag bar, where DJ Candi Take-It celebrated by playing Sir Cliff Richard's 1968 Eurovision classic Congratulations.
""Anything that brings investment into the city has got to be good, hasn't it?"" she said afterwards.
""We're only hosting Eurovision to support Ukraine, aren't we, because we didn't win it [this year]. The UK has decided to do that, and I'm glad that Liverpool won it, and sorry for Glasgow. Sort of!""
Friday's announcement came after a hotly-contested bidding process, which saw 20 possible host cities cut to a final two.
Glasgow had been the bookies' favourite, but Liverpool can now expect thousands of visitors and a slice of the global spotlight in May. Around 160 million TV viewers around the world watched this year's show live.
UK has hosted Eurovision eight times in the past, most recently in Birmingham in 1998. But 2023 will be the first time the contest has been in Liverpool.
A winning country normally hosts the following year's contest, but Essex singer Sam Ryder's second-placed finish this May led the UK to be asked to step in because of the war in Ukraine.
Last year's winners Kalush Orchestra will be on stage in Liverpool next year, and said on Friday: ""Playing in the same place that The Beatles started out will be a moment we'll never forget.
""Although we are sad that next year's competition cannot take place in our homeland, we know that the people of Liverpool will be warm hosts and the organisers will be able to add a real Ukrainian flavour to Eurovision 2023 in this city.""
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Liverpool, but said she was ""gutted"" for Glasgow.
Eurovision executive supervisor Martin Osterdahl said the city was ""synonymous with music"", and that Liverpool's arena ""exceeds all the requirements needed to stage a global event of this scale"".
He added: ""We have been very impressed with the passion the city has shown in embracing the contest and their inclusive ideas for placing last year's winners, Ukraine, front and centre when thousands of fans visit next May.""
BBC said both Liverpool and Glasgow had provided ""incredibly strong bids"".
roadcaster added: ""Liverpool has a fantastic venue, a beautiful backdrop of a city with a rich history of music, and a cultural offer that puts Ukraine at the heart of next year's song contest.""
ket details for the show have not yet been released. In fact, there won't just be one show - there will be nine.
As well as the live final on Saturday 13 May, fans will be able to watch a ""jury show"" on the Friday, which the international juries base their votes on, and a ""family show"" on Saturday afternoon, which is effectively a final rehearsal.
re will be two semi-finals on the preceding Tuesday and Thursday - and jury and family shows for each.
re will also be a programme of cultural events running alongside Eurovision itself - including artist exchanges and co-production between Liverpool and its sister city Odesa.
Ukrainian fashion, street art, orchestral musicians and painted eggs are among those plans - as is a trail of 20 life-sized cut-outs of Sonia, which people will be challenged to follow around the city.
11,000-capacity arena is on a former dock on the banks of the River Mersey - next to the vibrant Albert Dock, and along from the historic ""Three Graces"" (the Liver Building, Cunard Building and Port of Liverpool Building) on the waterfront.
In short, it will look great on TV.
It's next to a convention centre and an exhibition centre, which will be handy for hosting things like the press centre and other facilities, and has a couple of hotels on site.
It's also a short walk to the city centre's other hotels and rail links, and eight miles from John Lennon Airport.
's rich musical history already attracts hundreds of thousands of music tourists every year, and the arena's past major events have included the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2008.
ue is likely to have to postpone some concerts that are already in the schedule for next April and May, though, because it will be needed for preparations for six to eight weeks ahead of the song contest.
Although there is no confirmation yet of which shows will be moved, events currently in the diary include Sir Elton John on 22 and 23 April and Andre Rieu on 12 May. Olly Murs has just announced a show there on 6 May - but that may now be rearranged too.
After the announcement, Booking.com said 99% of hotels were booked up for 13 May, with the cheapest remaining room priced at £639."

Donaldson is one of the most popular people on the video-sharing platform, with more than 100 million subscribers.
He used that fame to open MrBeast Burger in 2020, which delivers from more than 1,000 locations worldwide.
And now he has a physical restaurant, at which fans queued for hours for a burger - and a chance to meet him.
restaurant opened in the American Dream mall, in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
After it had been open for two hours, Donaldson shared a video of the number of people waiting in line - which he estimated at more than 10,000.
Donaldson is part of a growing trend of stars who made their names online moving into the food industry but ignoring the traditional model of brick-and-mortar restaurants.
Celebrities have begun instead linking their names to food-delivery services operating out of the kitchens of other businesses
For example, in the beginning of 2022 fans in London could have a MrBeast Burger delivered to them from Shoreditch, in the east of the city - where it was made in the kitchen of a different burger joint, Dirty Bones.

In January, he launched his own chocolate company, with a mass giveaway campaign.
And in April, he claimed the business had given away $1.3m (£1.1m) in chocolate.
In 2021, he launched a philanthropy-themed YouTube channel, which has more than 10 million subscribers. 
And he now has a licensed charity that functions as a food bank to feed communities across the US.
Meanwhile, the day after MrBeast Burger's grand opening, Donaldson claimed he had broken the world record for the most burgers sold in a single day.
But he may have to hold off on calling himself the burger king just yet, because Guinness World Records has taken to Twitter to ask for proof."
entertainment	Warwickshire locations turned into WW2 France film sets	"Parts of Warwickshire have been transformed to look like 1940s France for a film to be released next year.  
Calling The Tune, a tale of ""lost love"" against a backdrop of war, is being filmed in locations across the county, said director Roger Harding.
film, partly inspired by true accounts, is based on a 2002 play written by Mr Harding for the Loft Theatre in Leamington Spa.
""[There] was a guy I knew personally who had to shoot somebody,"" he said.
A damaged 1940s Percival Sea Prince plane on a farm near Alcester was used for a scene based on the story of a neighbour who worked for the Special Operations Executive, he added.
""They were parachuting agents into France during the war and he was involved in that,"" said Mr Harding.
""On this particular occasion the agent was new, it was his first jump, he was very nervous. He pulled the ripcord too soon. This covers what happened afterwards.""

""There was a lot of waving cardboard around to get the smoke machine to send smoke in the right direction,"" she said. ""With the temperature dropping it was very atmospheric out here.""
With the drama set in a German-occupied town in the Loire Valley, film-makers scoured Warwickshire for locations that could pass as French.
""We've been using Coombe Abbey, for example, as a French chateau,"" said Mr Harding.
Brogans Irish Bar, in Warwick, was used for scenes in which a British agent tries to unify French resistance groups.

Calling The Tune is a co-production between Warwickshire not-for-profit Two Hats Films and period specialist Wartime Productions.

entertainment	The Crown: Netflix defends show after Sir John Major criticism	"Netflix has defended The Crown as a ""fictional dramatisation"" following criticism of its forthcoming series.
Sir John Major told The Mail on Sunday that a scene which apparently depicts a plot to oust the late Queen was ""a barrel-load of malicious nonsense"".
ude a conversation between the former prime minister and Prince Charles, as he was then, about the Queen abdicating.
Sir John's office told the newspaper there was never any such discussion.
""Sir John has not co-operated in any way with The Crown. Nor has he ever been approached by them to fact-check any script material in this or any other series,"" a statement from his office read.
""As you will know, discussions between the monarch and prime minister are entirely private and - for Sir John - will always remain so. But not one of the scenes you depict are accurate in any way whatsoever. They are fiction, pure and simple.""
However, a spokeswoman for The Crown defended the show, saying: ""The Crown has always been presented as a drama based on historical events.
""Series five is a fictional dramatisation, imagining what could have happened behind closed doors during a significant decade for the royal family - one that has already been scrutinised and well-documented by journalists, biographers and historians.""
will focus on the tumultuous early 1990s, which saw Prince Charles and Princess Diana separate.
Sir Malcom Rifkind, foreign secretary under Sir John, also criticised the popular drama, telling The Mail on Sunday that the scene featuring Sir John and Prince Charles was ""pathetic and absurd"", while broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby, a friend of the King, said: ""The Crown is full of nonsense, but this is nonsense on stilts.""
w series is released on Netflix on 9 November and is expected to show Prince Charles (played by Dominic West) cutting short a holiday with Diana, Princess of Wales to host a secret meeting with Sir John (Jonny Lee Miller), at his private residence, Highgrove, in 1991.
Imelda Staunton comes on board as the latest actress to play the late Queen, following in the footsteps of Claire Foy and Olivia Colman.
Some figures have defended The Crown's fictional interpretation of events.
According to The Times, Robert Harris, the historical fiction author and former journalist, said: ""I take a kind of heretical view in that I think The Crown has done the royal family nothing but good in some ways.""
Speaking at the Cliveden Literary Festival, he added: ""Nobody really takes it literally, do they? I'm not sure that they do.""
Prince Harry has also said it gave a rough idea of what living as a Royal was like.
He told James Corden in an interview last year: ""They [The Crown] don't pretend to be news. It's fictional. But it's loosely based on the truth. Of course, it's not strictly accurate, of course not, but loosely it gives you a rough idea about what that lifestyle, the pressures of putting duty and service above family and everything else, what can come from that.""
Netflix has previously stated that it will not warn viewers of The Crown that some scenes are fictional.
Responding to calls for a warning from the then Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden in 2020, the streaming giant said the series has always been billed as a drama.
""As a result we have no plans, and see no need, to add a disclaimer,"" it said.
However, a tagline on the Netflix show's home page reads: ""Based on historical events, this series dramatises the story of Queen Elizabeth II and the political and personal events that have shaped her reign.""
Mr Dowden said younger viewers ""may mistake fiction for fact"" when watching the fourth series, which showed the breakdown of the marriage between the then Prince and Princess of Wales.
Filming on the sixth series of The Crown was briefly suspended as a mark of respect after the Queen's death. It was also halted on the day of her funeral.
But there was consternation from some quarters about the fifth series being released two months after Her Majesty's death.
Loose Women presenter Brenda Edwards were among the figures suggesting it should have been delayed as a mark of respect."
entertainment	Dame Hilary Mantel: Rowling, Mosse and Evaristo lead tributes to late author	"Authors JK Rowling, Kate Mosse and Bernardine Evaristo have led the tributes to Dame Hilary Mantel, saying she changed the face of literature.
Dame Hilary, author of the best-selling Wolf Hall trilogy, died on Thursday aged 70, her publisher confirmed.
She won the Booker Prize twice, for 2009's Wolf Hall, the first in the Thomas Cromwell series, and its 2012 sequel Bring Up the Bodies.
""We've lost a genius,"" tweeted Harry Potter writer Rowling.
resident of the Royal Society of Literature, Evaristo said she was ""so sorry"" to hear the news and that she felt ""so lucky to have such a massive talent in our midst"". 
""I met her a few times and she was always so warm, down-to-earth and welcoming. RIP,"" the fellow Booker Prize-winning author said.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme, Labyrinth author and founder of the Women's Prize for Fiction, Kate Mosse, said Dame Hilary ""changed the face of how modern readers saw historical fiction"". 
""She was a very great writer... she kind of just had this exquisite way of capturing a place in a time within three sentences,"" Mosse said.
Pointing to her other, earlier works, Beyond Black and Everyday is Mother's Day, as well as her ""searing"" memoir, Giving Up the Ghost, Mosse went on to describe Dame Hilary as ""a writers' writer"" who ""became one of the most important readers [that] writers could have"". 
Mosse continued: ""The thing about Hilary Mantel was that she was a woman of extraordinary principle, she said what she thought, she wrote what she thought, she believed in the idea that your writing was your soul, if you like, out there.
""And she was unaffected by whether these views were popular or they were out of fashion, or she should do this or she should do that.""
Mosse concluded: ""She was a classic writer, but living in our modern times, and she will be remembered like George Eliot and [Charles] Dickens - I have no doubt that her works will never go out of print.""
Bill Hamilton, Dame Hilary's agent at literary agency A.M. Heath, told the same programme that her work, in both historical and contemporary fiction, always gave ""a sideways look, the sense always that the present was a place of complete uncertainty and danger that you never knew what was around the corner"".
""I think that sense of what lay in the Gothic, which was a kind of other universe lurking just slightly behind what you saw, infuses almost everything that she writes,"" he said.
I was lucky enough to interview Hilary Mantel many times.
I say lucky, because in person she was charming, polite and thoughtful.
On the page, however, she could be forthright, fierce and irreverent.
What strikes me most is the range of her work. From performing psychics in suburbia in Beyond Black, to an 18th Century Irish giant in The Giant and 800 pages on the French Revolution in A Place of Greater Safety. 
She was an intense and troubling writer and her subjects were odd and unpredictable. That made her work difficult to categorise and helps explain why she did not enjoy a wide readership until the success of Wolf Hall transformed her sales and profile.  
People loved the idea, she told me, that she had become ""an overnight success"".
But she confessed that made her ""feel a little bit sulky because I'd think, I've been writing since I was 22. I wrote for 12 years before I was published."" 
She leaves behind a body of work that I have no doubt will be read for years to come. 
fluential late author delivered the BBC Reith Lectures in 2017 and spoke herself about the power of art in bringing historical figures to life.
""As soon as we die, we enter into fiction,"" said Dame Hilary. ""Just ask two different family members to tell you about someone recently gone and you'll see what I mean.
""Once we can no longer speak for ourselves, we are interpreted. And when we remember, as psychologists so often tell us we don't reproduce the past, we create it.""
Dame Hilary's career-defining Wolf Hall was a fictional account of Thomas Cromwell's rise to power in the court of Henry VIII.
rd and final book in the series, The Mirror and the Light, was published in 2020 to much critical acclaim, became a fiction best-seller and was longlisted for The Booker Prize 2020.
rilogy sold more than five million copies globally and has been translated into 41 languages. 
Wolf Hall and its sequel Bring Up The Bodies were turned into a six-part BBC TV series starring Sir Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell, Damian Lewis as Henry VIII and Claire Foy as Anne Boleyn.
wo books were also adapted for the stage and enjoyed a run in London's West End, as did a 2021 adaptation of the third novel in the trilogy, The Mirror and the Light.
Actor and playwright Ben Miles, who helped Dame Hilary bring her work to the stage, described her as ""an extraordinary woman"", as well as ""a good friend and a close colleague"".
""I feel so honoured to have known her and to have contributed in a small way to the work of one of the greatest writers of our time,"" he told the BBC on Friday. 
""I shall dearly miss her kindness, her humour and her gentle tenacity. The indisputable genius of her words remains as some small consolation to this tragic loss.""
Writing on Twitter, Author Damian Barr said: ""With every book she redefined what words can do. 
""She's the only person I ever interviewed that speaks in whole, flawless paragraphs. I can't believe we won't have another book from her. Thinking of her family and friends. Such a loss.""
Historian Simon Schama tweeted: ""Shattered to learn of death of Hilary Mantel - one of the very greatest of our writers; poetic and profound prose with an incomparable feel for the texture of history.""
Peter Kosminsky, who directed the BBC adaptation of Wolf Hall, told Radio 4's PM programme: ""It's a terrific shock.
""I can't help feeling that a light has gone out in our rather rather benighted country. Hilary Mantel was an expert, she spent five years researching Cromwell and the Tudor period before she even put pen to paper. She was erudite on a range of subjects.""
""For those who knew her, for her husband Gerald, and all those who adored her books, we're not going to see her like again in our lifetimes."""
entertainment	Cost of living: Royal & Derngate theatre hit by rising costs	"A theatre is facing a ""double whammy"" of rising costs and cash-strapped customers, its chief executive said.
Jo Gordon, of the Royal & Derngate, in Northampton, said it was having to look at ""innovative"" ways to make money.
She said its fuel bills and show costs had both risen at time when audiences were also under financial pressure.
""All we can do is create the best experience and price things right,"" she said.
f the registered charity, which runs two theatre and two cinemas, is to make the arts ""for everyone"". 
""It's a challenge"", Ms Gordon told the BBC. ""For us, it's a bit of a double whammy. 
""We're dealing with our own bills and the escalation of that, but we're also dealing with the fact that most of our audiences are experiencing the same problem domestically.
""The ticketing income we rely on to cover those bills, staff wages, to keep us afloat are taking a knock as well. We're getting it from both sides.""
With 80% of its income coming from ticket sales and bar sales, Ms Gordon said the theatre was having to look at ""innovative ways"" to generate money.
""Customers are in that position, as are so many people, where they are having to really, really decide what they are going to spend, so are theatre tickets a luxury?"" she said. 
But she said for many people they were ""absolutely essential"".
""That escapism, that chance to have fun with family and friends is absolutely vital,"" she said.
""All we can do is create the best experience and price things right so people can build in a theatre trip as part of their monthly budget, but we don't underestimate what a big ask that is for everyone at that moment.""

entertainment	Ana de Armas fans told they can sue over Yesterday trailer	"Film studio Universal can be sued for false advertising after fans complained a movie trailer was misleading, a US judge has ruled.
wo fans of the actress Ana de Armas filed a lawsuit in January after renting the 2019 film Yesterday.
ress was seen in the trailer, but the pair were disappointed to find she had been cut from the final film.
ffs, Conor Woulfe and Peter Michael Rosza, each paid $3.99 (£3.31) to rent Yesterday on Amazon Prime. 
Woulfe and Rosza are seeking at least $5 million (£4.1m) from Universal in the case, which has been filed as a class action on behalf of other disappointed fans.
r argued they would not have paid the money to rent the film if they had known the actress did not feature in it.
California US district judge Stephen Wilson ruled that their legal action can go ahead.
Universal, the studio behind the film, sought to throw out the lawsuit, arguing that movie trailers are entitled to broad protection under the First Amendment, which protects free speech rights and the press.
udio's lawyers argued that a trailer is an ""artistic, expressive work"" that tells a three-minute story conveying the theme of the movie, and should therefore be considered ""non-commercial"" speech.
But the judge rejected that argument, ruling that a trailer is commercial speech and is subject to the California False Adverting Law and the state's Unfair Competition Law.
""Universal is correct that trailers involve some creativity and editorial discretion, but this creativity does not outweigh the commercial nature of a trailer,"" Wilson wrote in his ruling.
""At its core, a trailer is an advertisement designed to sell a movie by providing consumers with a preview of the movie.""
In their briefing on the issue, Universal's lawyers argued that it is not unusual for movie trailers to feature clips that do not appear in the finished film. 
referred to Jurassic Park, another Universal film, one trailer for which they said was comprised entirely of footage that is not in the movie.
Universal also argued that classifying trailers as ""commercial speech"" could open the door to many more lawsuits from dissatisfied filmgoers, who could make a subjective claim that a film did not live up to the expectations created by the trailer.
Wilson sought to address that concern, saying the false advertising law applies only when a ""significant portion"" of ""reasonable consumers"" could be misled.
judge said the court's holding was limited to cases where an actor or scene from the trailer does not feature in the finished film. 
In the case of the Yesterday trailer, he said, it was plausible that viewers would expect de Armas to have a significant role in the film.
De Armas, a Cuban-Spanish actress who starred in Knives Out, was originally set to appear as a love interest for the film's protagonist, played by Himesh Patel. 
Patel's character was to have met her on the set of James Corden's talk show, where Patel would serenade her with the Beatles song Something. Some footage of these scenes featured in the trailer. 
Richard Curtis, the screenwriter, explained that de Armas was cut because audiences did not like the idea of Patel's character straying from his primary love interest, played by Lily James.
In 2019, he said it had been a ""very traumatic cut"", because de Armas was ""brilliant"" in the role.
Yesterday tells the story of a young man who wakes up after a bicycle crash to find nobody on earth seems to remember The Beatles. 
He goes on to find fame and fortune by performing the songs himself, and faces a moral dilemma when he is credited as the writer.
Woulfe and Rosza's lawsuit will now proceed to discovery and a motion for class certification."
entertainment	Rare Jane Austen books could sell for £100,000	"A set of five first-edition Jane Austen novels could sell for more than £100,000 at auction. 
ks were bought by a UK-based private collector in the 1970s and 1980s for about £5,000.
re now due to be sold at auction in Gloucestershire by the daughter of the collector.
rarest of the five books is Sense and Sensibility as fewer than 1,000 were printed when it was first published anonymously in 1811.
Chris Albury, auctioneer and senior valuer at Dominic Winter Auctions in Cirencester, said: ""The current owner remembers her mother being particularly anxious one time after she had bought one of the books for £2,000 and told her husband to cancel the cheque that night.
""He wisely, in a long-term investment sense, said no. 
""She was a great fan of Jane Austen but these were the only rare books she ever bought and they would be brought out every now and then, treated carefully by the family, and then put back in the bookcase.
""We estimate she would have paid no more than £5,000 for all of these back then and they are now expected to fetch over £100,000.
""The daughter has had these for many years now and has decided to sell them through auction and let others get the pleasure from them and use the money for new projects and plans.""
Also being sold is a copy of Pride and Prejudice, which was published in 1813 in an edition of approximately 1,500 copies.
Mansfield Park was released the following year and Emma was published in 1816 - each in editions of 1,250 copies.
Finally, published a year after Austen's death in 1817, came Northanger Abbey and Persuasion in a run of 1,750 copies.
""The first four were published in triple decker format, three-volume sets that became standard practice for novels put out by British publishers in the 19th Century - cleverly forcing the new breed of fiction readers to pay for each novel three times,"" Mr Albury said.
He said first copies of Pride and Prejudice were the most sought-after by collectors, while Sense and Sensibility was valuable because of its rarity.
Mr Albury said interest in the auction, on 15 December, had come from transatlantic book dealers and ""seasoned Austen collectors looking to fill gaps in their collections"".

entertainment	Hilary Mantel: Friend and broadcaster Jan Rogers pays tribute	"A close friend of Dame Hilary Mantel has paid tribute to the ""attentive, generous and very funny"" Wolf Hall author, following her death, aged 70.
Jan Rogers, a former BBC Radio Derby producer, has lamented the loss of her ""best friend"", who she met in 1996.
71-year-old, from Nottingham, described Dame Hilary as a ""forensic thinker"" with a passion for ""fairness"" and ""all things intellectual"".
She became the first woman to win the Booker Award twice.
Dame Hilary, who was born in Derbyshire, won the prestigious honour for 2009's Wolf Hall, the first in the Cromwell series, and for the sequel, Bring Up the Bodies in 2012.
Ms Rogers told BBC Radio Derby: ""Like a lot of people who knew her, it's not sunk in that she's not going to be there, but I'm so pleased that everyone is talking about her. 
""Hilary was my closest friend for half of my adult life. I think she was probably one of the most attentive people you could meet. 
""She was very aware of what the other person was going through, she never forgot to ask what was going on, she was extremely kind, generous and very funny.
""I think her interests and perceptions were so wide and varied. No two books were alike, she was very interested in people's minds.
""She didn't want to write about relationships and emotions, she wanted to write about ideas, thoughts and how people got things done. 
""She was tremendously accurate whenever she did write anything that was based on truth. She would make sure that if it could be known it would be known.""
Dame Hilary died ""suddenly yet peacefully"" on Thursday, surrounded by family and friends, according to her publisher, HarperCollins.
Ms Rogers said they met when Dame Hilary visited Beeston Library for a publicity event.
roducer had been keen to attend after reading her novel, A Place of Greater Safety.
""I watched peacefully at the back of the talk and the librarian who booked her said to me: 'I never know what to say to authors', so she asked me to go to dinner with them,"" she said.
""We went to an Italian restaurant where I quoted huge tracts of her work back to her. It's a wonder she didn't run a mile.""
Wolf Hall was a fictional account of Thomas Cromwell's rise to power in the court of Henry VIII.
Among those who have also paid tribute to Dame Hilary are fellow authors JK Rowling and Caitlin Moran.

entertainment	Jimmy Kimmel returns to host Oscars 2023	"Jimmy Kimmel will host the Oscars for a third time when he fronts Hollywood's biggest event next spring.
r will be hoping for less controversy than last year when host Chris Rock was slapped by Will Smith.
Kimmel took the helm in 2017 - the year of  envelopegate - and 2018 before the Oscars went hostless for three years.
Oscars ratings have been falling in recent years although last year saw a slight improvement with the first full ceremony after the pandemic.
In a statement, Kimmel said: ""Being invited to host the Oscars for a third time is either a great honour or a trap. 
""Either way, I am grateful to the Academy for asking me so quickly after everyone good said no.""
Oscars executive producers and showrunners Glenn Weiss and Ricky Kirshner said they were ""super thrilled to have Jimmy score his hat-trick on this global stage"".
""We know he will be funny and ready for anything!"" they stated.
Next year's star-studded event will take place on 12 March. The Academy tweeted: ""Welcome back!"" to the talk show host as it shared the news of Kimmel's return.
During his last outing as Oscars host, Kimmel aimed barbs at Harvey Weinstein at the first Academy Awards since Hollywood's sexual harassment scandal unfolded.
Opening the event in 2018, Kimmel said: ""The Academy took action last year to expel Harvey Weinstein from their ranks.
""There were a lot of great nominees, but Harvey deserved it the most.""
Earlier this year, Kimmel found himself in hot water when he was accused of taking the spotlight from Quinta Brunson during the Emmys ceremony in September.
He was awarding the Abbott Elementary creator with the prize for outstanding writing for a comedy series but as part of a joke which began just ahead of the presentation, he stayed lying on the floor pretending to be drunk while Brunson made her speech.
He later apologised to Brunson on his Jimmy Kimmel Live! show for ""stealing your moment"", although Brunson had taken it in good spirits."

Owner Nathan Connolly said: ""This premises came up, it felt right and it was everything we envisaged.""
He continued: ""The issue was the owner required guarantors and the full first year's rent and that wasn't something I could afford to do. My earnings didn't cover the amount I needed to be a guarantor for. 
""We'd done crowd-funding before for our publishing business so that's something we decided to do for this project.""
He said it looked like they were not going to reach the goal but were then contacted by ""someone very kind and very generous"" who offered the remaining £7,000. 
""It meant we could open the shop,"" Mr Connolly said, adding the mystery benefactor wanted to remain anonymous. 
He said the benefactor liked the aims of the company to publish and promote books by local authors and that because the business is also a publishing house, authors, agents and publishers would be based on a Liverpool high street, not only in London. 
""We are part of the community, they can interact with publishing, it's not something that's happening behind closed doors,"" he said. 
Dead Ink Books has been an independent publisher since 2011 and was also awarded funding from Arts Council England.
Mr Connolly said they have plans to put on events, especially some for children.

entertainment	'Snakes, scorpions and 53C heat': Gloucester stuntman on SAS Rogue Heroes	"""I saw plenty of scorpions, and snakes were being caught before we got to set, to make sure it was safe.""
Olly Lloyd, 22, from Gloucester, was one of a team of stuntmen and firearms officers filming with BBC One drama, SAS Rogue Heroes. 
Filming took place for three months in Morocco in 2021, with temperatures reaching up to 53C on some days.
x-part drama is based on Ben Macintyre's SAS Rogue Heroes book, which charts the creation of the SAS.
A constant hazard for the production was sandstorms, which frequently disrupted activity on set. 
""We'd start very early in the morning and from there go through costume,"" said Mr Lloyd.
""That was providing we didn't get hounded by sandstorms - we'd be battling with sandstorms all day.""
SAS was formed in 1941, originally conceived as a commando force in the North African campaign during World War Two.
Mr Lloyd said the experience brought him closer to the original soldiers.
""You just crack on in the heat,"" he said. 
""You've just got to do what you're doing and do your job to the best of your ability. 
""It was embodying the spirit of what the SAS went through at that time, we were living in the same conditions that they did.""
Mr Lloyd is also quite modest about seeing the final product. 
""Yes and no, if you ask whether I'm looking forward to seeing it on TV,"" he said.
""I'm less concerned about myself but more wanting to see the good work that everyone else has done. 
""I was just a small cog in a big wheel.""
SAS Rogue Heroes will premiere on BBC One on Sunday 30 October at 9pm.

entertainment	N-Dubz: The reunion tour full of surprises	"After an 11-year hiatus, fans couldn't wait for the N-Dubz reunion tour. But after such a long break it hasn't been without a few hiccups.
Gigs have been plagued with reports of fighting, late arrivals and the trio had to reschedule their Nottingham show after cancelling at the last minute.
But many fans say the shows have been amazing and the band is already planning another tour next year.
Some gave BBC Newsbeat their verdict on the long-anticipated reunion tour.
meback shows begin with a bold opening.
Before Dappy, Fazer and Tulisa emerge on stage for their set, an announcement is made to the audience.
ghts go down and a woman's voice speaks.
""This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the annual N-Dubz purge.
""Commencing at the siren... any and all antics including shouting nanani, vigorous vibing, intoxication, toxic behaviour and drunk-texting your ex will now be mandatory.""
""The vibe in the arena didn't feel right from the get-go,"" says Emilie Masson.
She lives in Nottingham and didn't think twice about booking tickets to see the group at the Motorpoint Arena on 22 November.
For the 25-year-old, N-Dubz is about the nostalgia - it takes her back to her school days where she remembers boys wearing Dappy hats and girls being ""The Female Boss"".
N-Dubz had a string of hits between 2006 and 2011 - including Ouch, Papa Can You Hear Me and Number 1 - a chart topping collaboration with Tinchy Stryder.
""It just brings back so many childhood memories of listening to it,"" Emilie says.  
""But I feel like it's kind of been tarnished now that the comeback tour has not really been a success.""
She says people were getting ""really riled up"" as rumours spread among the crowd that Dappy may not be well enough to perform.
After support act Wes Nelson finished his set, and after the headliners were due on stage, a last-minute announcement finally confirmed the performance had been cancelled.
""And that was it - it just kicked off. It proper kicked off,"" says Emilie.
""People were fighting and throwing drinks,"" she says. ""People were screaming and shouting and pushing you towards get down the stairs.
""It just became very unhinged.""
Emilie says the gig was so chaotic she had doubts about returning for the rescheduled performance.
Not all fans had a bad experience and a lot of the reaction online has been positive.
""There was so much on social media about fights, how people couldn't control the behaviour and stuff like that,"" says Fredi Moore. 
""I was a little bit worried but it was nothing like what I'd seen on TikTok and other social media.""
Images and videos shared online show violence breaking out at a number of shows, including in Birmingham and Bournemouth. 
But 29-year-old Fredi from London saw the band with her brother in the city on 17 November and had such a good time she bought tickets to see them again on Tuesday.
""It was absolutely incredible,"" Fredi says. ""I'm so happy that I've done it again.""
And despite what she expected, she says the London shows were actually ""really peaceful and respectful"".
She thinks N-Dubz have been unfairly criticised for the actions of a minority of fans. 
""I feel like the band has got a lot of negativity because it's their fans,"" she says. ""But the people that are going in, they're all adults.""
Both Fredi and Emilie also think a lot of the online discourse about fans, which has included class slurs, is also unfair.
""I've seen a lot of negative comments from people that didn't even go to the concert being really negative and nasty about the concert goers,"" says Emilie. 
""They were saying, 'what did you expect from the N-Dubz fans, this is what you get when you live in a council estate and you listen to that kind of music'.
""I think that's really unkind.""
After going their separate ways more than a decade ago, the N-Dubz comeback has clearly been a success for the group.
ut 17 shows, including some of the biggest arenas in the country. Such was the demand, they had to add a further six dates - all arenas.
And they're already preparing for more, recently announcing a new single and a further 11 tour dates next summer.

Players Foundation (PF), the Professional Footballers' Association charity, intends to auction LS Lowry's Going To The Match in October.
It had previously loaned the 1953 work to Salford's Lowry arts centre.
In the letter, Salford Mayor Paul Dennett said he wanted to save the ""critically important"" painting. 
""If we save this painting, it will not sit idly in any basements out of view - or even static in a gallery,"" he said. 
""We will take the work around the country and beyond - and the story of how it was kept for the public will become part of its legacy.""
Salford Council said the letter had been sent to the leaders of the nine other Greater Manchester councils, the region's mayor Andy Burnham and a number of other prominent local figures, including former footballer and Salford City FC co-owner Gary Neville and bookmaker Fred Done.
In the letter, Mr Dennett said: ""All this at a time of unprecedented energy costs and high inflation, which has significantly impacted revenue and capital budgets across the entirety of local government. 
""In short, we cannot do this alone!
""But together with others, I believe we can preserve this iconic piece of L.S. Lowry's work, with a commitment to keeping it free to access for people in Salford, Greater Manchester and beyond.""
PF said the financial crisis meant it had to sell ""in the interests of our beneficiaries"" as it ""no longer has any income guaranteed, so we have had to completely reposition"".
Lowry, who died in 1976, spent much of his life in Salford and his work is strongly associated with the city.
Going To The Match is one of several football subjects painted by Lowry, who was always keenly interested in sport.
Many of the pictures have either direct or imaginary links with Burnden Park, the then-home of Bolton Wanderers, which was only a few miles from where the artist lived.
It won Lowry first prize in a 1953 exhibition, which was sponsored by The Football Association, and was last auctioned in 1999, when it was acquired by the charity for about £2m.
work will be sold at Christie's in London on 19 October.

health	Glan Clwyd: Serious failings led to death of man - inquest	"A man died from bronchial pneumonia in hospital after information regarding his care was not transferred correctly, a coroner's court has heard.
A hearing into the death of David Schofield Diamond found ""serious failings"" at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire.
79-year-old was admitted with pneumonia and sepsis two weeks before his death in November 2021.
Betsi Cadwaladr health board told the inquest plans to improve had been made.
Mr Diamond, from Prestatyn, had also tested positive for Covid-19 and was having difficulties eating and drinking. 
He was initially placed in the high dependency area of the Covid ward and his breathing was assisted, the hearing was told.
He was also assessed by the speech and language team, who recommended a soft diet of mildly thickened fluids. 
After about 10 days, his condition began to improve and healthcare staff discussed a discharge plan with him and his daughter. 
But when he was moved into another area on the same ward, the information regarding his fluids and diet was not transferred with him to the whiteboard above his new bed. 
ree days before his death, a physiotherapist noticed unthickened drinks on his bedside table, some of which had been consumed. 
On 11 November, Mr Diamond's condition deteriorated to a point where an assessment should have been made by the on-call doctor, with two-hourly observations then taken, and the nurse-in-charge informed. 
However, no observations were made for seven hours and the nurse-in-charge was not told. 
His condition continued to deteriorate and he became unresponsive. A chest X-ray showed there had been aspiration, and he was placed on intravenous antibiotics, but Mr Diamond died on 13 November. 
In a statement read to the coroner's court in Ruthin, the bank nurse looking after Mr Diamond overnight, Gwenda Long, said she had assumed the healthcare support team would do Mr Diamond's two-hourly observations. 
She said she did not escalate his condition to the nurse-in-charge or the assessment team because she had ""misread the term ward-based care"" in his notes, and thought medical escalation was not necessary. 
Giving a narrative conclusion, David Lewis, assistant coroner for north Wales, east and central, said the case showed a ""lack of recognition of deteriorating patient"" with ""human and communication errors"" involved. 
Mr Lewis said that though Mr Diamond had died from pneumonia, a natural cause, the aspiration that played a part was not natural, and it was ""likely"" he aspirated due to consumption of unthickened fluid in the hospital, in spite of recommendations. 
Mr Lewis added that though he could not be satisfied that it would have made a difference to Mr Diamond had a doctor been called at an earlier stage when his condition deteriorated, there had been ""serious failings"" in his care.  
Jane Woollard, associate director of nursing for the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board told the inquest that an improvement plan had been put in place following an investigation into Mr Diamond's death, which included the introduction of colour-coded information sheets on dietary requirements which move around the hospital with patients and a plan to train all nurses to carry out swallow assessments. 
Mr Diamond's daughter, Jody Diamond said she felt let down and was ""heartbroken"" by the loss of her father. "

According to the NHS website, it is spread by coughs and sneezes or through close contact with someone who is infected, and in serious cases can be fatal.
It can also be spread by sharing items such as cups, cutlery, clothing or bedding with an infected person. 
UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said there had been an ""increase"" in cases of diphtheria reported among migrants arriving in the UK.
It has confirmed 50 cases were identified as of 25 November, including among children. The figure stood at 39 on November 10.
Public health experts have raised concerns about the spread of the disease as migrants were moved to hotels.
UKHSA report said 38 of the cases have been reported in south-east England, with some cases also detected across London, the West Midlands and the north-east of England.
re offered to people on arrival at their new accommodation.
Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said any asylum seekers who may have the infection but are already in hotels will be told to isolate in their rooms while they are treated. 
He later confirmed the isolation centres would be similar to those used to curb infections during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Mr Jenrick told the Commons: ""From today, no-one presenting with symptoms will progress into the asylum accommodation system.
""They will either remain at Manston, isolating for a short period, or they will travel to a designated isolation centre in secure transport where they will be treated until deemed medically fit.""
reatment of migrants at the processing centre in Kent has triggered a wave of campaigns and concern from health professionals and campaigners. 
At one point, the facility designed to hold 1,600 people contained 4,000. 
Charity Detention Action launched a legal campaign to remove migrants housed in the facility for longer than 24 hours.  
Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the overcrowding was caused by a lack of suitable accommodation.
She told MPs: ""What I have refused to do is to prematurely release thousands of people into local communities without having anywhere for them to stay.""
A post-mortem examination is being carried out to determine the cause of death of the man who died after being held at Manston.  A test indicated ""diphtheria may be the cause"" of his illness, government officials have said."
health	East Midlands Ambulance Service workers begin strike action over pay	"East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) workers have begun strike action as part of a national pay dispute with the government.
24-hour action from ambulance staff across most of England and Wales on Wednesday is expected to affect non life-threatening calls only.
In the East Midlands, the action by the GMB union - which started at 06:00 GMT - will involve up to 50% of staff.
EMAS said it would aim to minimise the impact of strike action on patients.
means patients who have non life-threatening conditions will have to wait longer for an ambulance.
NHS said ""where safe and appropriate"", those people might be asked to make their own way to hospital, but should seek advice from 111 or 999 before doing so. 
rike will end at 06:00 on Thursday, and is set to continue from 06:00 on 28 December, to 06:00 on 29 December.
Ferdousara Uddin, regional organiser from GMB, said: ""It's not just about pay. It's about understaffing and the cuts being made that put patients at risk.
""The ambulance services are running at deeply unsafe levels and under extreme pressure every day.
""We need action from the government and proper investment into the service.""
Ms Uddin added: ""You can see and hear for yourself - it's been fantastic. We've had people stopping to speak to the ambulance workers to show their support.
""They've dropped off food, or just to have a chat"". 
Melissa Farrell, 36, a paramedic on the picket line in Lincoln, said: ""On Friday night I was on the back of an ambulance outside Lincoln A&E for seven hours followed by nine-and-a-half hours on Saturday night.
""It's about better working conditions for staff and for the public.
""We want to help the public and at the moment our hands are tied while we're stuck outside A&E. We're unable to get to those who truly need us. 
""We are here in the event of a real emergency, but at the moment we're overloaded with going to things which could be helped by other means.""
Her colleague Ellie Flinton, 30, said: ""There's a national shortage of nurses, paramedics, healthcare workers and we want the pay to be attractive so that people want to come into this job.
""We want our pay to be representative of what we do so people want to stay as well.
""In my opinion there are lives being put at risk every single day because of the way the service is currently running.""
One paramedic based in Nottinghamshire told PA News that patients' lives had been at risk ""longer than these strikes were even considered"".
m, 33, who did not want to provide his last name, said: ""I've attended elderly patients who have been on the floor with broken hips for over 20 hours.
""They've been waiting that long that their limbs have started to become necrotic (dying tissue), resulting in major surgery to remove said limbs.""
""In 14 hours I saw and attended one patient of my own and did not have a break... And there were, at one point, 11 ambulances stuck at (the) hospital unable to be freed back onto the road.
""The conditions we work in on a regular basis don't enable us to do the job we want to do to its full capacity and is putting patients' lives at risk long before strikes were even considered.
""We regularly go 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 hours without a break or even so much as a brew or any warm food, or food at all, due to these delays.""
""The ambulance service striking is one that has very little bearing on the grand scheme of things but hopefully has a big influence on highlighting the already failing NHS we so desperately need to treasure and invest in."" 
By Rob Sissons, BBC East Midlands Today health correspondent 
Another day, another strike. On Wednesday, it is the turn of ambulance workers and at England's second biggest ambulance trust.
re is a degree of apprehension about how the day will pan out. It is the GMB union that is striking with hundreds of members across many grades of staff from ambulance paramedics to call handlers. The ambulance service has always been about managing risk triaging 999 calls - those risks increase dramatically when a swathe of staff are missing on strike. 
GMB union says relations with the trust are good and they will liaise across the day. If there is a life-threatening emergency and no nearby ambulances, some strikers could be asked to come back to work. 
All disputes eventually come to an end but in the case of NHS workers, it feels like we in so many ways are stuck at the beginning. The government insists the pay claims are unaffordable in the current economic context. 
All sides are fighting for the hearts and minds of the public.
government has said it stands by a pay offer recommended by the independent pay review body and has criticised how the strike has been organised.
East Midlands Ambulance Service is made up of more than 4,000 workers represented by the GMB, Unison and Unite unions.
Unison has 1,296 staff at EMAS - made up of the likes of paramedics, technicians, call centre staff and mechanics.
Its members are not striking as the BBC understands they were 40 votes short of meeting the 50% threshold for action. 
New ballot papers for its members will be issued in the new year.
Ben Holdaway, director of operations at EMAS, said: ""During the period of the dispute, we will do all we can to minimise the impact on patient safety and will continue to work very closely with trade union colleagues, regional service providers and NHS employers.
""Patients should continue to call for an ambulance as normal if they experience a life-threatening emergency and should continue to access other more appropriate services for any other illnesses or injuries.
""We fully respect the right of NHS staff to take lawful and peaceful industrial action, however we do urge national employer representatives and trade union colleagues to proactively engage and reach a negotiated settlement to the dispute as quickly as possible.""
mes as a ""critical incident"" was declared across Nottinghamshire, due to high demand for hospital services. 
Operations have been cancelled, with nurses across the country also walking out on Tuesday.

health	Bristol team developing 'smart' menstrual cup and app	"A ""smart"" menstrual cup is being developed that aims to help empower women to get appropriate medical treatment and diagnosis.   
'Emm' cup is being developed by a Bristol team and is a reusable cup made from medical-grade silicone.
Currently in the second phase of testing, it is set to be launched in 2023.
GP and menopause expert Dr Julia Balfour said the Emm cup could reduce the need for invasive medical testing.
roduct aims to track the flow, volume, rate and regularity of menstruation and has sensors that connect with a smart phone app.
It has been designed to allow the user to track irregularities or changes in their cycle that could indicate a health issue, and its developers say it can also tell the user when the cup needs emptying.
Dr Balfour said certain female health conditions currently require invasive testing procedures and it would be ""lovely to imagine a world where this is being done effortlessly by a menstrual cup"".
CEO and founder Jenny Button said she had seen an opportunity to create a product that allowed women to ""non-invasively"" track their reproductive health.
""I wanted better health outcomes for women with the gender health gap,"" she said.
She said menstrual blood was rich in ""biomarkers"", which can provide information about health.
However, she said many woman were unable to identify reproductive symptoms due to not having access to their own menstrual health data.
One of the most common reasons women visit their doctor is due to heavy bleeding, says Ms Button, adding that one in five women suffer from menorrhagia - a condition that causes heavy menstrual bleeding.
""No one has the information on their menstrual volume at present, so diagnosis requires invasive tests or individual subjective recall of product usage."" 
Ms Button also hopes to encourage more women to transition to menstrual cups, reducing the number of period products that go to landfill each year.

health	South Western Ambulance Service declares critical incident	"South Western Ambulance Service has declared a critical incident after having 700 calls waiting to be dispatched on Tuesday.
rvice will take various measures, such as cancelling staff training, to address demand, according to BBC West health correspondent Matthew Hill. 
It comes on the eve of the first ambulance strike in over 30 years ago set for Wednesday, 21 December.
usands of staff are taking action in a dispute over pay and staffing levels.
BBC understands even at the busiest times pre-pandemic the service would be used to half the number of calls it received on Tuesday.
People have already been urged to only call 999 in life-threatening emergencies ahead of the strike action. 
Staff will leave the picket line for emergencies, union Unison said.
A government minister said if people need an ambulance they ""should most definitely seek that in the usual way"". 
m Pursglove, a minister for disabled people, health and work, said it was ""absolutely essential"" that ministers continue to engage with the unions. 
""But also that the NHS works tirelessly in local areas to make sure that the right cover is in place,"" he added.
government has said that about 1,200 members of the military and 1,000 civil servants will be drafted in to cover for striking ambulance and Border Force staff over Christmas.
Speaking ahead of Wednesday's strike action, Will Warrender, chief executive at the service, said they were ""sorry"" for any delays in response times.
""The public can help us by only calling 999 for life-threatening emergencies, we absolutely must have crews available for the most life-threatening conditions and we will be prioritising these patients,"" he added.
He asked people not to call back asking for an estimated time of arrival of an ambulance and said that if a patient's condition is not life-threatening they may be directed to alternative services.
Mr Warrender spoke as the service said there were 420 patients waiting for ambulances across the area on Monday, with 152 ambulances outside hospitals waiting to handover patients.
Kevin Stephens, from Gloucestershire, waited for more than 15 hours with his mother for an ambulance after her GP said she might have deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and needed to go to hospital. 
Speaking to BBC West, he said: ""She is housebound so we couldn't drive her there or take a taxi. 
""When we got there they found she had a blood and urine infection - she wasn't able to have a scan for the DVT because the equipment wasn't working.""
She later spent the a night on a reclining chair because there was not a bed available before she was transferred to a ward, he said.
Mr Stephens said he had ""mixed emotions"" about the strike because he is ""very worried"" about his mother but is also ""very angry about the state the health care system is in"". 
""I don't blame the NHS workers for this,"" he said.
""Thousands of people up and down the country are really suffering. Our NHS is broken and it needs to be fixed.""
As well as planned strike action, cold weather and busy hospitals are putting increasing pressure on the service, the ambulance service said.
Chris Hewett, from Unison, said there were ambulance stations are spread out across the South West and ""we're confident that our Unison members who are on the picket line will want to respond to any emergencies in their local communities"".

health	Fresh talks to avert strike by NHS Scotland staff	"re will be fresh talks on Tuesday to try to avert a strike by NHS staff in Scotland, BBC Scotland understands. 
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf is expected to meet health unions. 
It's thought the Scottish government is prepared to divert more money from elsewhere in this year's budget to improve the current offer - without making a further raid on NHS spending.
Health unions are threatening a walk-out before Christmas unless the existing pay offer is improved. 
government offered a flat rate of £2,205 per person, backdated to April - an average salary increase of 7% with the lowest paid gaining more than 11%. 
However unions have described it as a real-terms pay cut as inflation - the rate prices are rising - hit 11.1% in October.
Royal College of Nursing has asked for at least 5% above inflation. 
Unite, the GMB union and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy have also backed strike action. 
About 1,500 ambulance staff, including paramedics, who are members of Unite will take industrial action - including a work-to-rule and overtime ban - on Friday. 
GMB Scotland's members in the Scottish Ambulance Service will strike on 28 November.
It is understood that Unison - Scotland's largest health union - has also rejected the latest pay offer and will now ballot its 50,000 members on industrial action. 
government has previously said there is no more money for public sector pay rises and that a strike would be ""catastrophic"".
Scottish ministers have repeatedly said there is no more money in this year's budget for improved public sector pay deals. 
rikes in the NHS during this period of enormous pressure on the service would be ""catastrophic"". 
In other words, they have little option but to make a fresh effort to avert industrial action. 
Nicola Sturgeon appealed to the UK government - which faces a similar dispute - to come up with more cash. 
While the chancellor found some extra cash for the NHS and social care over the next couple of years, his autumn statement did not contain new money for use now. 
means the Scottish government will have to divert cash already allocated for other things. 
It's not clear how much they've found or exactly where it's coming from but it's not thought to involve a fresh raid on NHS spending. "
health	Covid in China: People rush to book travel as borders finally reopen	"Chinese people have rushed to book overseas travel after Beijing announced it would reopen its borders next month.
Passport applications for Chinese citizens wishing to travel internationally will resume from 8 January, the immigration administration said.
It follows an announcement on Monday that ended almost three years of strict quarantine rules for arrivals.
ravel sites have since reported a spike in traffic.
But Chinese tourists will not have unfettered access to all countries.
Officials in the US are considering new restrictions on travellers from China due to concerns about a surge in cases and a lack of transparency from the Chinese government.
""There are mounting concerns in the international community on the ongoing Covid-19 surges in China and the lack of transparent data, including viral genomic sequence data,"" US officials said in a statement quoted by news agencies.
""Without this data, it is becoming increasingly difficult for public health officials to ensure that they will be able to identify any potential new variants and take prompt measures to reduce the spread.""
Japan - one of the most popular destinations for Chinese travellers - has announced that all travellers from China must show a negative Covid test on arrival, or quarantine for seven days, because of the surge in cases there.
India has also said travellers from China (as well as some other countries) must show a negative Covid test when they arrive - though this was announced before Beijing's easing of restrictions.
g of travel rules in China - the last part of the country's zero-Covid policy - comes as the country battles a new wave of infections.
Resentment against the government's policy - which sparked rare public protests against President Xi Jinping in November - led to a relaxation of Covid restrictions across the country.
But an increase in Covid cases followed, with reports of hospitals overwhelmed and a shortage of drugs.
uncement on outbound travel on Tuesday came after Monday's news, which axed quarantine rules for travellers arriving in China. It also scrapped a cap on the daily number of flights.
On the same day, the National Health Commission announced that Covid would be formally downgraded to a Class B infectious disease on 8 January.
Before the relaxation of travel rules, people were strongly discouraged from travelling abroad. The sale of outbound group and package travel was banned, according to marketing solutions company Dragon Trail International.
Within half an hour of Monday's notice that China's borders would reopen, data from travel site Trip.com - cited in Chinese media - showed searches for popular destinations had increased ten-fold year-on-year. 
Macau, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand and South Korea were the most popular destinations.
In addition, Chinese travel agency Qunar saw flight enquiries on its website increase seven-fold within the first 15 minutes after the announcement, the China Daily reports.
Before the pandemic, the number of outbound tourists from China stood at 155 million in 2019, according to Statista. This number dropped to 20 million in 2020.
r, some people in China will hope to visit family and loved ones during Chinese New Year, which begins on 22 January.
But inside China, there has been a mixed reaction.
""I'm happy about it but also speechless. If we're doing this [reopening] anyway - why did I have to suffer all the daily Covid tests and lockdowns this year?"" said Rachel Liu, who lives in Shanghai.
She said she had endured three months of lockdown in April - but nearly everyone in her family had become infected in recent weeks.
She said her parents, grandparents and partner - living across three different cities in Xi'an, Shanghai and Hangzhou - had all come down with fever last week.
Many have also expressed concern online about borders reopening as Covid cases peak.
""Why can't we wait until this wave passes to open up? The medical workers are already worn out, and old people won't survive two infections in one month,"" read one top-liked comment on Weibo.
People in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, which experience chilly temperatures in the winter, say they're running out of flu and cold medicine. 
It's feared that hundreds of deaths may be going unreported as crematoriums are overwhelmed. 
In the capital, Beijing, authorities say they are planning to distribute the Pfizer tablets, Paxlovid, in order to try to reduce the severity of infections. But health centres contacted by The Global Times on Monday said the drug had yet to be delivered.
On Monday, President Xi issued his first remarks on the changes, calling on officials to do what was ""feasible"" to save lives.
China's about-turn has put Mr Xi in a tough spot. He was the driving force behind zero-Covid, which many blamed for restricting people's lives excessively and crippling the economy. 
But having abandoned it, analysts say he now has to take responsibility for the huge wave of infections and hospital admissions. Many have questioned why the country was not better prepared.

health	NI health: Northern Ireland is 'getting the health service we pay for'	"People in Northern Ireland are getting ""the health service we pay for"", the Department of Health's top civil servant Peter May has said.
He warned that without sustained investment people must ""recalibrate"" their expectations on service delivery.
rmanent secretary said fundamental questions must be addressed on the health service's future.
It comes as the Royal College of Nursing confirmed its plans to take strike action before Christmas.
On Friday, the trade union said its members in Northern Ireland, England and Wales would walk out on 15 and 20 December in a dispute about pay and staffing levels.
Mr May told the annual conference of the Northern Ireland Branch of the Healthcare Financial Management Association in Belfast it was getting harder to deliver what people needed.
""With the resources available to us, we are finding it increasingly difficult to deliver the health and social care system needed to meet all the demands of the population,"" he said.
""We all want to get back to a health service that provides timely care to everyone who needs it when they need it.
""That's far from guaranteed. Without sustained funding, it will be impossible,"" he continued.
Mr May told delegates that while ""many actions"" could be taken to ""make health and social care more efficient and effective….we must not pretend that efficiencies alone will close the widening gap between demand and supply.""
Mr May added: ""The reality is also that our ageing population and advances in medical science mean the gap between demand and capacity is growing year-on-year, winter-on-winter.""
r civil servant also told the conference ""it remains the case that the overwhelming majority of the most sick patients receive very high quality care.""
""At the same time, many people requiring less time-critical care are having to wait much longer - often in pain and discomfort. This is not the level of care that the public expects or that any of us wants to provide.""
He also told stressed to delegates the ""importance of not losing hope in face of the current challenges"".
Revealing details about its strike action, Pat Cullen, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said nursing staff ""had enough of being taken for granted, enough of low pay and unsafe staffing levels, enough of not being able to give our patients the care they deserve"".
Under trade union laws, the union has to ensure life-preserving care is provided during the strikes, which will last from 08:00 to 20:00 GMT."
health	Fauci: 'Low-life trolls harass my wife and kids'	"America's top infectious disease expert, who became the face of the pandemic with his daily television updates, has spoken out against ""low-life"" trolls harassing his wife and children, figuring out where they live and their phone numbers. 
""I have good security protection, but I really think it's so cowardly to harass people who are completely uninvolved, including my children,"" Dr Anthony Fauci told the BBC's Americast podcast. 
Dr Fauci, who became a target for online conspiracy movements after advising on the Covid-19 pandemic, said he tries his best not to be distracted by online hate that ""takes away from your ability to do your job"". 
As chief medical adviser to the US President he was the country's top medical expert and the voice of the government's pandemic response, during both the Trump and Biden administration, providing daily updates to the American public, encouraging mask use and vaccination. 
He frequently clashed with former President Donald Trump, who once threatened to fire him.
Conspiracy theorists accused Dr Fauci of playing a key role in a sinister plot to control and harm people with Covid-19 and vaccines, contrary to the evidence. 
wo people have previously been arrested and imprisoned in the US for what Dr Fauci described as ""credible attempts on [his] life."" 
He warned about a ""tsunami of misinformation and disinformation"" in his country, including on social media. But he refused to comment on Twitter's recent decision to stop labelling and removing Covid-19 misinformation, because he feared being accused of ""trying to suppress people's freedom of speech"".  
81-year-old is stepping down as chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden this month and head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). 
Dr Fauci has served under seven presidents, including Joe Biden, Donald Trump and Barack Obama, starting with Republican Ronald Reagan during the HIV AIDS epidemic.
But he was thrust further into the public eye during the Covid-19 pandemic, where decisions he and other scientific advisers made about restrictions and medical advice were under scrutiny. 
At times, he clashed with Donald Trump's approach to managing the pandemic.
Watch: Key moments: Fauci and the pandemic
He said it was not easy to publicly disagree with a sitting president and that it ""generated an extraordinary amount of hostility"" from ""far-right"" activists in the US. 
When asked whether the severity of lockdowns in some American states was misjudged, Dr Fauci disagreed. 
He dismissed the approach taken by Sweden, which did not immediately go into lockdown, but advocated voluntary social distancing.
""I would not under any circumstances adopt the Swedish model because if you look at the deaths and hospitalisations in Sweden compared to other Scandinavian countries, it's much, much worse,"" Dr Fauci told Americast. 
Dr Fauci, who will turn 82 on 24 December, said he will continue to work in healthcare.

health	Lioness Demi Stokes opens up about her crazy entrance into the world	"Lioness Demi Stokes who was born 10 weeks early weighing 3lb (1.3kg) has shared her birth story to show premature babies are strong.
Manchester City and England star said she had a ""crazy entrance into the world"" after being born in a toilet.
30-year-old footballer has opened up to mark World Prematurity Day.
""I probably was quite small when I started playing football, but it just meant I had to work a little bit harder,"" she said.
""And actually, once I did fill out, I probably overtook the bigger guys,"" said Stokes, who joined Sunderland's youth academy aged eight and by 16 was playing in the first team.
""I think that's what I'd say to other parents now - don't worry if they're small and if they might be a bit late to develop, because we catch up. 
""We need to let little premmie babies know they are strong and... very robust.""
Stokes and her partner Katie Harrington have a six-month-old son, Harlen, who was born six weeks early weighing 5lbs (2.3kg).
He needed to spend a week in hospital after being born via emergency Caesarean.
She said it was only since becoming a parent it had sunk in what an anxious time it must have been for her own mum.
""But it's interesting because when I do speak to my mum about it, she doesn't ever say, 'Oh, it was horrendous'... I feel like she must have blocked it out.""
She said she had two other siblings who were also premature and while they were healthy, ""everyone's experience isn't the same"".
Stokes said she had shared her story to help start conversations around what experiencing a premature or difficult birth could be like for those going through it.
""It's important we talk about it,"" she said. 
Her partner also had pre-eclampsia, which she became seriously unwell with.
""It was really scary... I remember thinking, 'Demi, just have a poker face' - because if I crumble, I'm not going to help Katie,"" she said. 
She believed the skills she learned as a footballer, in terms of mental focus and staying calm under pressure, helped in the moment. 
""But inside, I was panicking and I was worried, definitely,"" she shared. ""I think not until after, when she came home, then I was like, 'You were really poorly, you were really unwell'.""
Stokes added that both were doing well now - and despite being ""a little early"", Harlen's ""really filled out and thriving"".

health	Cornwall to trial at home health checks	"A landmark trial aimed at making it easier for patients to carry out health checks has been launched in Cornwall.
Patients will complete online questionnaires, take blood samples at home, and complete blood pressure checks at a pharmacy or GP surgery.
rial is the first of its kind and comes as part of the government's plan to digitalise the NHS Health Check.
Public health minister Neil O'Brien said the checks would ""reduce pressure"" on services.
NHS Health Check is a health check-up for adults in England aged 40 to 74 designed to prevent stroke, kidney disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some types of dementia.
A total of 15 million people are eligible for free NHS Health Checks in England, according to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).
ks are currently delivered face-to-face by GPs, but many parts of the check can be done without a GP.
w trial aims to free up time for more urgent GP appointments, the DHSC said.
More than 2,000 people from three GP surgeries across Cornwall are being invited to take part in the trial - only those whose results indicate an underlying health condition will be followed-up by their GP.
results of the trial will help inform the design and development of the new national NHS Digital Health Check.
Minister for public health Neil O'Brien said: ""Innovation is key to a modern, forward looking National Health Service, and this trial will help us understand what a new digital NHS Health Check could look like in the years to come.
""During the pandemic people got used to doing tests at home and getting their results online, so this trial is an opportunity for us to apply some of the lessons we learnt during Covid and improve the way we deliver healthcare.""
Dr Andy Sant, managing director of NHS Cornwall's north and east integrated care area said he was ""delighted"" patients in Cornwall were being given the first opportunity to access the digital health checks.
According to the DHSC, the offer of NHS Health Checks has been historically lower in Cornwall than most local authorities in England.
During 2019-20, over 13,400 checks were offered and over 6,900 were completed, but in 2021-22 approximately 4,300 were offered and just over 1,900 were completed.
Cornwall councillor Dr Andy Virr, portfolio holder for adults and public health, said it was ""great news"" the trial was being carried out in the area.

ment could lead to a urine test being developed to detect the beta-catenin mutated form of liver cancer after the researchers discovered the metabolite in mice.
Dr Saverio Tardito, who is leading the project, said the number of people with liver cancer was expected to rise and new tools to detect and treat it earlier were needed.
""We were excited to discover this new metabolite which had never been described before in mammals,"" he said.
""It is a good candidate for diagnostic testing as it's specific to a particular type of liver cancer, can be easily detected in urine, and could potentially be used as a marker to monitor the growth of tumours.""
for the test was discovered by a team exploring a protein known to be prevalent in liver cancer - glutamine synthetase.
While studying this enzyme in normal liver tissue in mice, the team discovered a new metabolite not previously identified in mammals which is produced by the enzyme.
It appeared in high levels in mice with a specific type of liver tumour and the levels rose as the tumour grew.
metabolite, called N5-methylglutamine, also appeared in urine when the tumour-promoting mutation of the gene beta-catenin is present, meaning it could be used to identify patients with this specific type of cancer.
Dr Tardito said: ""We now plan further studies to investigate how early in liver cancer the metabolite appears, to identify how early a urine test could reliably diagnose the disease.""
Every year in the UK there are around 6,200 new liver cancer cases, with around 610 of those in Scotland.
Liver cancer rates are higher in Scotland than the UK average and around a quarter of liver cancer patients have the beta-catenin mutated form of the disease.
Diagnosis of liver cancer is often late, with many patients diagnosed only when already receiving treatment for existing diseases such as cirrhosis or fatty liver disease.
But early, non-invasive testing could help catch the disease earlier, increase the effectiveness of existing treatments and boost development of new therapies. "
health	Speedo Mick set to start final fundraising walk	"A fundraiser famous for walking in his tight blue Everton FC swimming trunks is set to start his last big challenge.
In eight years Michael Cullen, also known as Speedo Mick, has raised more than £800,000 through his challenges.
58-year-old said he hoped his final walk - spanning 1,000 miles (1,600km) from John O'Groats to Land's End - would take the total to more than £1m.
""That would just be a perfect ending to the Speedo Mick stomps, wouldn't it, a million quid?"" Mr Cullen said.
Mick hopes to walk at least 15 miles a day for up to three months in aid of The SpeedoMick Foundation.
rity will give grants to small charities that support mental health awareness, disadvantaged young people, and the homeless.
Mick first earned his nickname after fundraising £30,000 swimming the English Channel in 2014.
wo years later, he raised more than £50,000 for a Liverpool hospice by walking from Everton's Goodison Park stadium to Wembley Stadium.
In 2019 and 2020 he raised more than £300,000 after walking from John O'Groats to Land's End and in 2021 his 2,500 mile (4,023 km) Giving Back Tour raised almost £180,000.
""It's bittersweet,"" he said of his various challenges. ""It's given me a purpose to be busy and to be positive and to give back as well.
""And every single person who's donated, shared my posts, said 'keep going'... every single person who has done that for me over the last eight years, they've all been part of this journey.
Mick, who has previously shared details of his own personal mental health challenges, has said his fundraising was a way to thank people who had helped him.
Speedo Mick spoke to BBC Breakfast about his battle with depression
On his final walk, starting on 29 December, he plans to scale the Britain's three national mountain peaks - Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike, and Mount Snowdon - along the way.
While admitting he was not quite yet feeling up to his last trek, Mick said putting on his Speedos lets him ""get into the groove"".
""I get the energy from them,"" he said.
""When I get in my kit and I've got my bag on and all my flags are flapping about in the wind, that's when the challenge begins.""

health	Covid in China: US imposes Covid testing for visitors from China	"US has become the latest country to impose Covid testing on visitors from China, after Beijing announced it would reopen borders next week.
Italy, Japan, Taiwan and India also announced mandatory tests, but Australia and UK said there were no new rules for travellers from China.
After three years of being closed to the world, China will let people travel more freely from 8 January.
But the country's ongoing Covid surge has sparked wariness. 
China is reporting about 5,000 cases a day, but analysts say such numbers are vastly undercounted - and the daily case load may be closer to a million. Hospitals are overwhelmed and residents are struggling to find basic medicines, according to reports. 
On Wednesday, the US said a lack of ""adequate and transparent"" Covid data in China had contributed to the decision to require Covid tests from 5 January for travellers entering the country from China, Hong Kong and Macau.
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this was needed ""to help slow the spread of the virus as we work to identify... any potential new variants that may emerge"".
But Beijing's foreign ministry on Wednesday had said coronavirus rules should only be instated on a ""scientific"" basis and accused Western countries and media of  ""hyping up"" the situation.
Some people reacted angrily on China's censored social media. 
""I thought all of the foreign countries had opened up. Isn't this racism?"" read one comment that was liked 3,000 times on Weibo. The US has said testing is required of anyone coming from China, or via a third country, regardless of nationality.
But others said they understood the reason for the conditions: ""This is nothing compared to all the restrictions we had for people coming into China,"" one user wrote. 
Beijing only announced on Monday its decision to end quarantine for arrivals - effectively reopening travel in and out of the country for the first time since March 2020. Until this week, anyone entering China had to undergo quarantine in state facilities. 
Before the pandemic, China had been the world's largest outbound tourism market. But it's unclear how many Chinese people will travel abroad after 8 January given that the number of flights are limited, and many citizens need to renew their passports. 
rnational community's reaction has varied with the UK and Australia saying they were monitoring China's Covid situation but were not planning on announcing new testing requirements.  
Others have moved swiftly to announce restrictions:
European Commission said its health security committee would convene on Thursday to discuss ""possible measures for a coordinated EU approach"" to China's Covid surge. 
But Italy, an EU member state and an epicentre of the virus in late 2019 and 2020, said it was moving first to ""ensure the surveillance and identification"" of any new variants of the virus.
Flights arriving in Milan this week were already testing passengers from China. Authorities found 52% of passengers were infected with Covid on one flight that landed on 26 December.
Initial tests of Covid-positive travellers arriving from China showed that 15 of them had Omicron variants that were already present in Italy, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said. She described the news as quite reassuring.
Italy is one of 26 European countries in the border-free Schengen zone and Ms Meloni is calling for EU-wide testing of Chinese passengers, arguing that Italy's own measures might otherwise be ineffective. 
China's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that ""currently the development of China's epidemic situation is overall predictable and under control"". 
However, the true toll of daily cases and deaths in China is unknown as officials have stopped requiring cases to be reported, and changed classifications for Covid deaths. On Sunday, officials said they would also stop releasing daily case counts.
""The infection surge in China is on expected lines,"" Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, an Indian epidemiologist and health systems specialist told the BBC in a recent interview. 
""If you have a susceptible population that is not exposed to the virus, cases will rise. Nothing has changed for the rest of the world.""
China's decision to reopen its borders marks the end of the country's controversial zero-Covid policy, which President Xi Jinping had personally endorsed. 
Even as the rest of the world transitioned to living with the virus, Beijing insisted on an eradication policy involving mass testing and stringent lockdowns.
my took a hit and people grew both exhausted and angry - in November, the frustration spilled onto the streets in rare protests against Mr Xi and his government. Week later, Beijing began to roll back the restrictions."
health	Assisted dying: 'I was arrested for taking someone to Dignitas'	"A retired NHS worker spent 19 hours in custody and was investigated by police for six months for chaperoning a woman to her assisted death in Switzerland.
Sue Lawford went with Sharon Johnston, who was in a wheelchair after a fall left her paralysed, to Dignitas from her home in mid Wales.
70-year-old said police, who arrested her the day after returning from Switzerland, were ""aggressive"".
Dyfed-Powys Police said assisting a suicide was a criminal offence.
force said a ""thorough criminal investigation"" was required to establish the facts but added that the case has been closed and no-one will face charges.
British law states anyone who is said to have encouraged or assisted the suicide or attempted suicide of another person can be jailed for up to 14 years.
Baroness Ilora Finlay, a former Royal Society of Medicine president and professor of palliative care, said the law must protect vulnerable people.
Ms Johnson, 60, who had no immediate family following the death of her parents and brother, went to Switzerland to die six months after the former pub landlady and betting shop worker told a BBC TV programme she planned to spend £14,000 to end her life.
Mrs Lawford, a retired GP surgery manager, did not know Sharon and only met her once before they travelled, but agreed to help her as a member of group My Death, My Decision, which supports changes to the UK law on assisted dying.
Retired NHS worker Sue Lawford spent 19 hours in custody
Mrs Lawford admitted ""it wasn't the easiest decision"" to help Ms Johnson, a tetraplegic, get to Dignitas but she said she ""couldn't hand on heart come up with a good enough reason to say I wouldn't help"".
Ms Johnston travelled from her home in Cardigan, Ceredigion, in a disabled taxi to London's Heathrow Airport on 14 February for the journey to Dignitas, picking up Ms Lawford in Cardiff on the way.
""Sharon was so rational, pragmatic and down to earth about the whole thing,"" said Mrs Lawford.
""She had been getting rid of stuff to the charity shops and things like that. There was this feeling that it was all quite imminent.""
But not long after they set off, Ms Johnson received her first call from police. Mrs Lawford said she believed the carers who went to Sharon's home four times a day had reported her missing. 
She said she thought Mrs Johnston received two calls from the police and one from social services on the journey to the airport, each time Mrs Johnston told the authorities that she was OK. 
Ceredigion council has said it would not comment on individual cases but Mrs Lawford said those calls were ""stressful"".
""We didn't really talk about it in the taxi but I think we both felt that any minute we would see a blue light and we would be stopped on the motorway,""  she added.
""She was worried that she wouldn't be able to go through with it.""
Once they arrived at Dignitas, Ms Johnston was assessed by a doctor and psychiatrist on whether she was able to make a rational decision about ending her life.
But Mrs Lawford said armed police then turned up.
""There was a knock on the door and looking out through the blinds, we could see it was the Swiss police,"" she added.
""The police here had asked the Swiss police to intervene. So more stress for Sharon. It was extremely upsetting and frightening.
""The police were very business-like but Swiss police are armed for a start, and it's not something we are used to seeing in this country.
""They were perfectly polite and asked lots of questions, both separately and together. I can only assume that they were reassured. 
""Sharon was very calm and rational and the police eventually left and must have reported back to the police in the UK.""
following day, Ms Johnston ended her life at the clinic and Mrs Lawford returned home.
She was woken early the following morning at about 05:30 GMT by banging on her front door.  
""The dog went absolutely berserk,"" Mrs Lawford recalled. ""My husband and I nearly jumped out of our skins. He went down to answer the door and just called up and said 'Sue you better come down, it's the police'.""
As she stood in her pyjamas, Mrs Lawford was told she was being arrested and said an officer led her to a police van and made her sit in the cage at the back.
She said she was held for a total of 19 hours, 16 of them in a police cell, before being told that she was being released under investigation.
Dyfed-Powys Police said: ""It is a criminal offence in the UK to encourage or assist in the suicide or attempted suicide of another person. 
""The circumstances of such cases increase the risk of vulnerable people being exploited and others making financial gain,"" the force said a statement.
""A thorough criminal investigation is required to establish the facts of each case, requiring action to secure evidence that may be lost as time passes and prevent opportunities to dispose of relevant evidence. 
""Following such an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Sharon Johnston the matter has been closed.""
Officers have said the two people who were arrested as part of the investigation have been told they ""face no further action"".
figures from prosecutors suggested just four cases of assisted suicide have been prosecuted in the UK, with the majority not leading to charges.
Mrs Lawford will speak at an event in Westminster Hall on Tuesday organised by My Death, My Decision, which wants the law changed so that people ""of sound mind"" who are ""terminally ill or incurably suffering"" can be allowed to end their own lives.
f assisted dying has been debated in Parliament numerous times and the latest Assisted Dying Bill, which proposed allowing terminally ill adults to be helped to end their own life, was discussed in its second House of Lords reading last year but failed to make it to law.
Campaigners against the proposed change raised concerns it could leave some patients vulnerable to coercion.
Cardiff cancer hospital consultant Baroness Finlay worried that once implemented legislation could expand to include the disabled, children, the mentally ill or those suffering trauma.
She said: ""If you are considering legislation you must think who are you putting at risk.""
She added she thought it was ""dangerous"" to put doctors in a position where they could end lives and added they should be working to improve, not shorten them. 
""The role of the law has to be to protect everyone who is vulnerable and it has to look to protect the most vulnerable from being pressurised into things that they should somehow end their lives,"" she said.
""That is the law at the moment and the director of public prosecutions has very clear guidance as to which cases should be pursued and which shouldn't.
""Sadly there are always people who, at a time of something awful happening, feel complete despair.
""But we know that with appropriate support and help, they come out the other side and often can live very well and go on to be glad that they are still alive. It is too dangerous to licence a doctor to provide lethal drugs to their patients."" 
Assisted dying has been decriminalised in several European countries, including Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands while a bill to legalise assisted dying has now been introduced in Scotland, which could bring about changes next year.
British Medical Association has now moved to a position of neutrality on assisted dying. 
MPs last voted on changes to the right to die in England and Wales in 2015 and the UK government said any change to the law ""in an area of such sensitivity and importance"" is for individual MPs to consider rather than government.
""Our sympathies remain with the families and loved ones affected by these deeply upsetting cases,"" the Ministry of Justice added.
Mrs Lawford said she understands the police were doing their job when they questioned her but feels the law should change - and hopes she is never asked to accompany anyone on a trip like this again.
""I have not actually talked about it to many people but when I do I don't sleep very well for a couple of nights."" she said. ""It is a massive thing.""

health	China zero Covid: Violent protests in Guangzhou put curbs under strain	"Crowds of residents in southern China's industrial metropolis Guangzhou have escaped a compulsory lockdown and clashed with police, as anger at strict coronavirus curbs boiled over.
Dramatic footage shows some tearing down Covid control barriers. Riot teams have now been deployed in the area.  
It follows Guangzhou's worst Covid outbreak since the pandemic began.
Amid bad economic figures, China's zero Covid policy is under enormous strain.

rea is home to many poorer itinerant labourers. They have complained of not being paid if they are unable to turn up for work, and of food shortages and skyrocketing prices while living under Covid control measures. 
For several nights, they'd been tussling with the white-clad Covid prevention enforcement officials, and then overnight on Monday the anger suddenly exploded onto the streets of Guangzhou with a mass act of defiance.
Again, unsubstantiated rumours have played a role. Stories have spread that the testing companies are faking PCR results to artificially boost the number of infections in order to make more money.
In the north of the country, the coronavirus rumour mill is also building pressure.
Officials in Hebei Province announced that the city of Shijiazhuang would halt mass testing. But this led to speculation that the population was going to be used, guinea-pig-style, to monitor what would happen if the virus was allowed to spread unchecked. 
Discussion of this has appeared on social media platforms under the hashtag #ShijiazhuangCovidprevention.
Many panicking locals have stockpiled Chinese medicines which are said to help with Covid infection. Supplies in the city are said to have virtually run out for the moment.
A similar viral rumour led to the mass breakout of workers at the Foxconn complex in the central city of Zhengzhou two weeks ago, which has hit the global supply of Apple iPhones.
Local governments across China are struggling to maintain a zero-Covid approach without trashing their economies. The latest official factory output and retails sales figures show the crushing impact of the pandemic and the government's policy response to it.
re are no provinces at all which have reported zero cases in recent days.
Around 20 million people in the heart of western China's mega city of Chongqing have been placed under a type of lockdown being referred to ironically by people as ""voluntary static management"". This is because, though there has been no official announcement, they've been told to remain indoors by community officials. 
Online there have been jokes that the Chongqing government didn't want to announce a mass lockdown on the same day that measures easing zero-Covid rules across China were revealed.
Because Covid amelioration still dominates life here, even a small shift in the way it is being administered can cause consternation and panic.
At the beginning of this week, officials in Beijing's Chaoyang district decided to close many of the street-side testing booths and move them into housing compounds. There was a sudden cut in the number of PCR stations. The problem is that many office buildings require a daily result, or you can't enter. 
So at the booths that were open, the queues were enormous.
From the workers stuck in Tibet who protested to leave Lhasa, to the lockdown of the entire region of Xinjiang, zero-Covid is not going smoothly.
A series of changes announced last week slightly toning down the rules were seen as a sign that more easing was possible down the road. But even if the government is considering this, it may not be soon enough."

Askern Medical Practice sent the text message to people registered with the surgery in Doncaster on 23 December. 
Sarah Hargreaves, who was waiting for medical test results, said she ""broke down"" when she received the text, only to be later told it was sent in error.
group which runs the surgery said nobody was available for comment. The centre has almost 8,000 patients.
first text told recipients they had ""aggressive lung cancer with metastases"", a type of secondary malignant growth.
It directed patients to fill out a DS1500 form, which allows people with terminal diseases to claim certain benefits.
However, about an hour later people received a second text telling them it was an error and it was meant to wish them a merry Christmas instead.
Ms Hargreaves said after she received the original text while she was out shopping, she ""felt sick to my teeth and broke down"".
She added: ""I had just had a mole removed and was awaiting a result from a biopsy and I had been to hospital as my smear test came back abnormal, so yes, I was very worried.""
Despite repeated calls to the surgery, she said she struggled to get through to speak to someone.
Carl Chegwin, another of the surgery's users who, along with his mother, received the text, said he was left upset by the out-of-the-blue message which ""was enough to break someone"".
""The first thing I thought was, 'is this some kind of sick joke?'"" Mr Chegwin said.
""It completely took me by surprise... It's not often I go to the doctors, then out of the blue, it's cancer. I'm sat there scratching my head thinking, 'I do smoke, do they know something I don't?'""
""They've just told people a few days before Christmas they've got terminal lung cancer. They can't do that.""
Meanwhile, a woman, who asked not to be named, said she was left feeling ""very worried"" about the text, with family members recently having tests about ongoing chest issues.
""I rang the doctors but on hold as usual. So, I walked round as I live around the corner and there were, I'd say, six people all there panicking as they had got the same text.""

""What if that message was meant for someone, and then they are told it's a Christmas message, then again told, 'oh no, that was actually meant for you'?"" Mr Chegwin asked.
""If it's one of their admins that's sent out a mass text, I wouldn't be trusting them to empty the bins.""

health	French vote for right to abortion in constitution	"France's National Assembly has backed a bid to enshrine the right to abortion in the constitution, prompted largely by increased restrictions elsewhere.
Lawmakers voted by a large majority to include a clause guaranteeing ""the effectiveness and equal access to the right to end pregnancy voluntarily"".
Left-wing MP Mathilde Panot, who is behind the change, said it was to protect against the ""backsliding"" seen in the US and Poland.
But the bill will face a tough passage.
Last month the upper house, the Senate, rejected a similar proposal and is thought unlikely to back the new amendment. Right-wing parties - which dominate the Senate - argue that abortion rights are not under threat in France.
A change of constitution would also have to go to a referendum, although opinion polls suggest more than 80% of French voters are behind it.
Ms Panot's amendment went through after securing the support of MPs in Emmanuel Macron's ruling Renaissance party, but a reference to the right to contraception was scrapped.
Macron MP Aurore Bergé had been due to present her own abortion amendment next week but withdrew it, telling MPs how her mother had endured an abortion without anaesthetic before it was legalised in 1974.
""The question of access to abortion and of protecting it isn't a whim; it shouldn't be politicised; it's not a matter of party politics,"" she said.
Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti also backed changing the constitution and praised the ""historic"" vote.
Last February, the French parliament voted to extend the legal timeframe for abortion from 12 to 14 weeks, similar to neighbouring Spain. It is lower than other European countries, including Sweden, the Netherlands, England, Wales and Scotland. 
Ms Panot dedicated Thursday's vote to women in the US, Poland and Hungary. Her push to change constitution was triggered by a vote in the US Supreme Court to end the national guarantee to abortion access, overturning the landmark Roe v Wade ruling in 1973.
rteen US states have since begun enforcing abortion bans, while voters in states including California backed proposals this month to enshrine the right to abortion in their constitution.
Poland has a near-total abortion ban and this year began enforcing a ruling that terminating pregnancies with foetal defects was unconstitutional.
Meanwhile, Hungary's nationalist government recently tightened restrictions on abortion to require pregnant women to prove a foetus's sign of life before requesting a termination."
health	Egypt mothers misled into Caesarean sections - campaigner	"Caesarean section rates are significantly higher in Egypt than other parts of the world, with some doctors accused of deliberately steering expectant mothers to choose this for their own convenience - and as a way of making money.
""The doctor chose C-section not to interrupt his annual leave,"" Mai Shami told the BBC, referring to the experience of a mother from her group. The doctor to whom she was referring allegedly decided to deliver the baby at a time which worked for him, rather than let it happen naturally.
A Caesarean section is when a baby is delivered by making a surgical cut in the abdomen and womb. They can be:
A year ago, Mai launched a Facebook initiative called Stop Medically Unjustified Caesarean Section, which is followed by more than 12,000 people around the Arab world.
was a fruit of her personal experience of giving birth two years ago.
""Doctors were pushing me towards Caesarean section as if it were the only, best and most appropriate way to give birth,"" she said.
""During pregnancy, I visited more than one doctor and most of the time they pushed me towards Caesarean section for reasons, some of which are male-motivated, as they said a normal delivery may affect a woman's sexual relationship after birth."" 
Although evidence for this claim is inconsistent, obstetricians and gynaecologists who the BBC spoke to said this claim is often used by doctors to encourage more women to opt for a C-section. 
One doctor that Mai visited gave a different reason for C-section, telling her it was ""quicker, easier and less painful than a normal delivery"".
Some doctors were making money by encouraging women to have C-section as the procedure was more expensive than natural birth, Dr Randa Fakhreddin, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist in Cairo, told the BBC. 
Doctors can also perform more than one C-section in a day, whereas natural births can potentially take hours.
According to the Egyptian Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, privately-owned hospitals where C-sections are carried out make more profit from them than natural deliveries, as the fees are much higher. 
uld explain why C-sections account for 80% of births in these hospitals, while C-sections account for only 40% of all births in state-owned hospitals.  
Mai insisted on giving birth naturally after spending a lot of time reading about the advantages and disadvantages of both methods of birth, and making sure she did not need a C-section for any medical reasons. 
was supported by the doctor who treated her in the final stages of delivery. 
Caesarean sections: Why and when are they used?
Encouraging women to opt for a C-section without medical necessity is common in many countries around the world.  
World Health Organization (WHO) advises that a maximum of 15% of births should be via Caesarean section, but most countries exceed this limit. C-sections around the world have tripled in three decades, with one in five children born through it. 
Egypt ranks fourth in the world in terms of C-sections, according to a WHO report, with 51.8%. 
Egyptian ministry of health says 72% of Egyptian women had C-sections in 2021. It has taken steps to reduce the number of unnecessary C-sections, like bringing fees into line with those for natural births; giving financial incentives to medics to encourage more natural births; and monitoring methods used by hospitals. 
Mai says it is the weakness of the health system in monitoring hospitals and doctors which has been the main problem.  
Mai Shami says lack of information can lead women to make decisions without insufficient knowledge - something her initiative aims to change.
Salma, a 32-year old mother, backs her campaign. She underwent a C-section months ago and says her doctor did not explain the alternatives.
""He didn't talk to me about the options I had. He just talked to me about Caesarean section and asked when did I want to give birth,"" she said. 
""He also did not tell me about the complications that might occur after C-section and how I can deal with them."" 
Salma said that if she had known all the details about giving birth naturally, she could have assessed the situation better.
Mai says women are also part of the problem, as they encourage each other to undergo C-sections either for the lack of information or because they are afraid of natural birth, not helped by social media, soap operas, and some doctors themselves.   
Dr Fakhreddin meanwhile said the health system in the country made doctors frightened of taking risks, which meant they chose C-sections as a procedurally safer choice. If doctors make mistakes, they could be sent to court, which could spell the end of their careers."

health	No ambulance to meet helicopter patient at hospital	"A patient was airlifted to Glasgow Airport as no ambulances were available for a 300 yard transfer from the helipad at an East Ayrshire hospital.
ual, who was picked up by an air ambulance on Arran, was then driven 26 miles from the airport back to Crosshouse Hospital, near Kilmarnock.
Both the Scottish Ambulance Service and Scottish government have apologised for the delay.
A Tory MSP said the patient's experience was ""truly terrifying"".
Details of the case, first reported by LBC, emerged amid mounting winter pressures on the NHS.
resulted in an appeal by NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde for patients only to turn up at A&E if their situation is urgent or life-threatening.
And on Wednesday NHS Lothian confirmed relatives of some hospital patients are to be asked to provide care for their loved ones at home in a bid to free up beds.
In the latest example of the strain on the system it has emerged a patient was airlifted to Crosshouse earlier this month having taken unwell on the Isle of Arran.
But after the helicopter landed it became clear there were no ambulances available to complete the short journey from the helipad to the hospital.
Instead they were flown about 25 miles to Glasgow Airport where they they met an ambulance crew who drove them back to Kilmarnock. 
A Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said: ""Whilst we are limited in what we can say due to patient confidentiality, we can confirm we transported a patient from Arran to Crosshouse Hospital via air ambulance on Thursday 8 December 2022. 
""Unfortunately, extended hospital turnaround times at Crosshouse Hospital at that time meant a delay to the ambulance and therefore the aircraft had to divert to Glasgow Airport to avoid icing in the bad weather. 
""We apologise for any distress caused.""
A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""We are aware of this incident and understand that the ambulance service are looking into the circumstances. 
""We expect steps to be taken to ensure incidents of this kind do not occur again, and we apologise to this patient for their experience and hope they are recovering well.""
Claire Burden, chief executive of NHS Ayrshire & Arran, said its hospitals were experiencing ""extremely high demand"" for unscheduled care services.
She apologised for the longer waiting times experienced by some patients, and said they were working with the Scottish Ambulance Service to reduce avoidable waits. 
Scottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane said the story was a damning indictment of the current state of the health service.
He added: ""This will have been a truly terrifying situation for this patient and my thoughts are with them. 
""It lays bare the total chaos that Humza Yousaf is presiding over in our NHS, despite the best efforts of dedicated ambulance crews.
""Going back and forth between different health boards, having already been in an air ambulance, will have caused huge distress and anxiety for this suffering patient.""
Dr Gulhane also called for the patient to be given an ""urgent apology"" after a chain of events he described as ""utterly shameful"".
Meanwhile, on Tuesday it emerged more than a third of people attending at A&E departments were not seen within the Scottish government's four-hour target in the first full week of December.
Data from Public Health Scotland (PHS) showed that in the week to 11 December, 62.4% of people were seen and subsequently admitted, transferred or discharged within the target time.
Scottish government aims to have 95% of people seen within the four-hour target.
But last month the country's hospitals recorded their worst ever accident and emergency waiting times.
In a separate development, NHS Lothian bosses are urging anyone asked to provide care for a relative on an interim basis while waiting for a package of social care to be put in place to ""give the request some serious consideration"".
rd's chief executive Calum Campbell said the move comes as the health service comes under ""unprecedented"" and ""sustained"" pressure.
It comes at a time when the NHS is dealing with large numbers of emergency patients, at the same time as medics are seeing an increase in respiratory illness.
Delayed discharge, where patients are medically well enough to leave hospital but have to stay while they wait for care arrangements to be put in place, is also increasing pressure on the service, the health board said."
health	Dad brands A&E a sick joke after baby's Telford care delay	"A father of a child who suffers from seizures has called the ""chaos"" they faced at A&E a ""sick joke"" as she ""struggled to breathe"". 
Darren Childs from Ludlow, Shropshire, is calling for improvements to emergency departments in the county.
He said the situation at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford had already followed an ambulance delay.
rust said services remained under ""significant pressure"". 
It added staff were working incredibly hard to make sure children were seen as quickly as possible.
Mr Childs said his one-year-old's life had been ""put on the line"" for a second time on Tuesday after she suffered a seizure.
Myla ""went grey and her lips went blue, it was clear she was struggling to breathe,"" he said. 
In January, Mr Childs and his wife Cally waited 36 minutes for an ambulance after Myla had a similar fit.
During Tuesday's ordeal the ambulance service ""couldn't guarantee a fast response"", he said, so the couple drove their daughter to nearby Bridgnorth Hospital where she received help from ""amazing"" staff.
""But they couldn't get Myla's oxygen levels back up and stabilised,"" he added, so an ambulance was called to transfer the patient to Telford.
It took half an hour for it to arrive which felt like a ""lifetime when you're watching your child struggling to breathe"", he said. 
Mr Childs described A&E when they arrived in Telford as being ""stretched to breaking point, or worse than that"".
""There was blood on the floor. There was people sleeping on the floor. It was absolute chaos. 
""The nurse told us it would take around 10 hours before Myla could even see a doctor. That isn't emergency care, that's a sick joke.""
While the couple waited, their daughter's oxygen levels gradually stabilised and returned to normal and they ""began to feel the immediate life-threatening episode was over"". 
rents then drove their daughter back to Ludlow to be seen by the family's GP.
Mr Childs, a councillor for the Ludlow parish, blamed the delays on an NHS that had been ""underfunded and understaffed for years"".
He said: ""It's bad across the country, and in Shropshire we're right at the sharp end of things. 
""We have been campaigning since January to try and help the situation because it's only got worse as the months have gone on.""
Myla remained ""under the weather"", he said, but ""she's on the mend and she's got some antibiotics and is being monitored closely by a GP"".
Hayley Flavell, director of nursing at The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, said: ""Our urgent and emergency care services remain under significant pressure, and we apologise to patients who are experiencing long waits for treatment.""
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it was investing an additional £6.6bn in the NHS over the next two years including more than £4.4m for Shropshire.

health	Avoid contact sports during ambulance strikes, says minister	"Health Minister Will Quince: ""There will be disruption on the day (Wednesday)""
A health minister has suggested people should avoid contact sport and unnecessary car journeys during ambulance strikes on Wednesday.
Will Quince said people should take ""extra care"" due to disruption, and he wouldn't go running on icy roads due to the additional risk.
Around 750 armed forces staff are being drafted in to cover the walkouts in England and Wales.
Mr Quince said ambulances should still respond to the most serious calls.
Speaking on BBC Breakfast earlier, he said people should avoid ""risky activity"" during the strikes, without specifying what he was referring to.
Labour MP Chris Bryant called the comments ""an admission of government failure"".
Pressed on his earlier comments in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, Mr Quince said: ""If there is activity that people are undertaking tomorrow, whether it's - for example - contact sport, they may want to review that"".
Asked if people should go running, he said this was not ""hugely risky"", but added: ""Would I go running tomorrow if it was still icy? No I wouldn't, because that would encompass additional risk"".
But Downing Street would not be drawn on a definition of ""risky activity"", with the PM's spokesman telling reporters ""I'm not going to get into a list"". 
He added: ""We would never recommend anyone put themselves in harm's way on any given day.""
Earlier, Mr Quince said ministers wanted ambulances to respond to category 1 and 2 situations, including cardiac arrests and strokes, during the strikes. Health Secretary Stephen Barclay will meet unions later to discuss service levels.
Mr Quince said military staff would not be able to drive ambulances under blue lights, go through red lights or break the speed limit - but would help ambulance staff to get people to A&E more quickly.
Health chiefs have warned of ""extensive disruption,"" and urged hospitals to free up beds by safely discharging patients ahead of industrial action.
Measures should also be put in place to make sure ambulance patient handovers are kept to no more than 15 minutes, they advise.
Mr Quince added that for less serious categories, NHS trusts would be block-booking taxis to take people to hospital, and ""encouraging people wherever possible"" to find treatment by making journeys themselves.
Dr John Martin, president of the College of Paramedics, told MPs on Tuesday that using taxis could prove ""far less safe"" than ambulances for some patients.
Speaking at the Commons health committee, he said pain relief would not be available, and without an on-site medical assessment some people might be sent to hospital unnecessarily. 
Ambulance availability during the strikes will depend on local agreements between unions and NHS trusts.
Rachel Harrison, national secretary at the GMB, one of the striking unions, told the committee most of these deals have now been signed off. 
She added that ""life and limb"" cover would be provided across the board, but warned services would vary by area.
Along with the GMB, Wednesday's action will also involve members of the Unison and Unite unions. GMB members are also due to on strike again on 28 December.
Unions representing NHS staff in England and Wales are pushing for higher pay after being offered a below-inflation average 4.7% rise this year.
Unison has said troops are ""no substitute for trained ambulance staff"" - and a rethink on NHS wages from the government could have averted action.
rike will follow strikes from nurses on Tuesday in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, who are taking their second day of action this month over pay.

health	Strep A: Cheshire pharmacies report amoxicillin and penicillin shortages	"Pharmacies in Cheshire have reported a shortage of antibiotics used to treat strep A. 
Demand for penicillin and amoxicillin has increased recently after a rise in the number of cases in children.
Hannah Sami, who manages a pharmacy in Wilmslow, Cheshire, said she had ""never seen"" so many prescriptions and she had completely run out of amoxicillin. 
government said there were good supplies of antibiotics and stock could be moved around if there were issues. 
UK Health Security Agency figures show 15 children in the UK have died after invasive strep A infections since September.
re have also been 47 deaths from strep A in adults in England.
Most strep A infections are mild but cases of more severe, invasive strep A infections - whilst rare - are rising.
Symptoms like a sore throat or skin infections occur in mild cases, though the bug can also cause scarlet fever. 
It is treated with antibiotics which may also help reduce the risk of complications and spread of the bug.
Dr Andrew Hill, a drugs expert at Liverpool University, said amoxicillin was in ""severe shortage"" worldwide at the moment, with health authorities in France, Spain, Brazil, the United States and Canada all reporting a lack of supply. 
""It seems to be down to a surge in demand as people, especially children, are getting this thing called respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and afterwards, they can have a high risk of bacterial infections,"" he said.
""The estimates are that there are 10 times more cases of scarlet fever this year than there were last year.""
Ms Sami said her pharmacy had run out of amoxicillin and only had two doses of penicillin left.
""For the last week, I've just not been able to get amoxicillin,"" she said.
""We're definitely having supply issues.
""This is not down to normal winter pressures, I've never run out like this before.""
She said she had ""never seen so many amoxicillin prescriptions"" and other pharmacies had experienced similar shortages.
""I don't think anyone has it at all and I'm not aware of any deliveries,"" she added.
A pharmacy in nearby Alderley Edge told the BBC it had similar shortages of amoxicillin.
""It's in real short supply at the moment,"" a representative said.
""Pharmacy managers are calling around asking for it [but] no-one has any.""
Wilmslow GP Dr Fari Ahmad said the picture was similar in other parts of the North West. 
""This is not something I've experienced before"", she said. 
""We've had reassurances from the government that there's not a supply issue, but at the front line, that's not what we're seeing.
""I know lots of our local surgeries are struggling to accommodate everybody.""
She added that her colleagues were ""already spread really thin and this has taken a big toll"".
""We're kind of being left on our own to try and find our way out of this.""
Health Secretary Steve Barclay said on Wednesday that checks within the Department of Health had not revealed an issue with supply of medicines.
He said the level of supply was ""not a concern at the moment"", but stock could be moved around if there was an issue with particular GPs getting supplies.
A Department of Health and Social Care representative said there was ""no supplier shortage of antibiotics available to treat strep A"". 
""As the Secretary of State said, we sometimes have surges for products and increased demand means some pharmacies are having difficulties obtaining certain antibiotics,"" they said.
""We are working urgently with manufactures and wholesalers to explore what can be done to expedite deliveries and bring forward stock they have to help ensure it gets to where it's needed, to meet demand as quickly as possible and support access to these vital medicines.""

health	Care workers paid £8,000 less than NHS equivalents in England - study	"A care worker in England is paid on average £8,000 a year less than NHS staff with the same skills, research for a care provider suggests.  
rity, Community Integrated Care, also told BBC News it was having to provide food parcels for some staff who were struggling to pay their bills. 
Separate research shows low pay is the most common reason why care staff quit.
government said it was ""incredibly grateful"" to carers and recognised their ""extraordinary commitment"".
A spokesperson added: ""That's why we prioritised social care in the Autumn Statement, providing up to £7.5bn over the next two years."" 
Many health professionals are struggling financially, with nurses due to strike over pay for a second time on Tuesday.
However, Community Integrated Care - one of the UK's largest providers of support for people with learning disabilities and autism - says pay pressures facing social care are now ""untenable"" and ""immoral"".
On average, the study found:
research, by job evaluation experts Korn Ferry, found care workers' wages have risen since last year, but the pay gap with the NHS has increased by about £1,000.
Other jobs with similar skill levels, such as senior teaching assistants, are paid an average of £26,327, again significantly more than care workers, Korn Ferry found. 
Mollie Moorby, 23, works with adults with physical and learning disabilities in Stockport, Greater Manchester. ""This is my dream job, helping people,"" Mollie told the BBC. 
She is trained to support people with their daily life, including with their health needs and food. 
Mollie started looking after her own mother as a teenager, and gradually realised she wanted to work in a caring role. However, on £10 an hour she struggles to put food on the table and cannot afford to turn on her heating. 
""When you're working 40 to 50 hours a week and you put in everything, not only physically, but mentally, emotionally - for lack of better words - it doesn't seem fair.""
With the cost-of-living crisis, things became so difficult that Mollie asked her bosses at Community Integrated Care for help. As a result, they started providing food parcels for staff in need, and they have given out more than 80 since September.
""With the food parcels, it has been a lot easier,"" says Mollie. ""You get necessities, things that are expensive, like laundry detergent. That was stressing me out for a while."" 
rity says it has already used its financial reserves to increase wages for Mollie and her colleagues. However, it says it cannot raise them further because it is now running at a loss - as the fees it receives from councils for providing support are not enough.
""We are subsidising the contracts that local authorities are asking us to provide,"" says Teresa Exelby, from the charity. ""We want to do absolutely everything we can, but as a charity that is not sustainable. Fundamentally, the system is absolutely broken."" 
A separate report, published on Monday by the Homecare Association, which represents companies caring for people in their own homes, reaches a similar conclusion, with almost all the firms that responded saying it is harder than ever to recruit and keep staff.
fficial figures, published in October, show 165,000 job vacancies in adult social care in England, up 52% in a year.
Homecare Association study says among staff, the most common reason for leaving is needing to earn more money and more than half say they feel burnt out, stressed or exhausted.
government says its Made With Care recruitment campaign aims to boost careers in adult social care and it is also investing £15m in hiring from overseas. 
In England, the national living wage for over-23s will rise to £10.42 from next April.
In Scotland, care workers have been paid a minimum of £10.50 an hour since April this year, and in Wales, they will be paid at least £10.90 an hour from June 2023."

health	Bristol defibrillators 'a no brainer' after rugby player's death	"A call has been made for more defibrillators across a city after the death of a rugby player.
Sam Polledri, 24, died from a heart attack in Millennium Square in Bristol in February. 
f the lowest numbers of automated external defibrillators in England.
Councillor Steve Smith said installing more ""is a no brainer"" and would improve the chances of people surviving cardiac arrests.
re were five defibrillators close to Mr Polledri when he died - but they were all behind locked doors.
Earlier this year, a defibrillator was installed metres away from the site where he died after his parents fundraised for it.
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the Conservative councillor for Westbury-on-Trym and Henleaze said plans for more defibrillators would not ""impose extra costs"" on Bristol City Council.
Large developments could be required to include publicly available defibrillators and new taxi drivers could be trained on basic CPR techniques and how to use the devices. 
A charity could also work with the council on installation and maintenance.
Mr Smith said a similar programme had been rolled out in Swansea, with the city council there working with charity Heartbeat Trust UK. 
Swansea now has 459 automated external defibrillators, one of the highest numbers in the country.
Councillors will discuss the proposals on 13 December.

health	NI health review 2022: From pandemic to industrial action	"wn of a new year usually brings optimism but the Covid-19 pandemic has meddled with all that and the start of 2022 was no different. 
We started the year talking about Omicron which was quickly identified as being significantly more transmissible than Delta, the preceding variant of concern. 
Within weeks, as the Omicron wave travelled around the world, it replaced Delta as the dominant variant and spread at an exceptional rate. 
More than 300 people were hospitalised over Christmas 2021 and 34 spent the new year in ICU. 
As this year draws to a close, Group A streptococcus has replaced Omicron in the headlines and although the number of cases has started to fall slightly, parents everywhere remain vigilant. 
Hospitals, GP surgeries and community care have all buckled under increased pressure. 
Earlier this month, BBC News NI filmed inside the Royal Victoria Hospital's emergency department and it revealed a system that was broken and staff who were burnt out. 
Lead nurse Claire Wilmont said ""providing dignified care in overcrowded emergency departments is a daily challenge"".
Claire added that staff struggle daily to find space to ""treat the sickest of the sick, including resuscitating patients"". 
ures were shocking, the stories harrowing, but without a working government and a health minister, it's hard to know what the response will be.  
Northern Ireland's hospital waiting lists remain the highest in the UK, including those for gynaecological surgery.
Some stories stand out including that of Claire Nicholls who waited almost four years for surgery for endometriosis. 
Claire told BBC News NI that the delay caused damage to her reproductive organs which may affect her ability to have children. 
After several years of being in the wilderness - it seems Bengoa's report for reshaping hospital services is finally starting to see light. 
re was a positive response to the creation of three dedicated surgical hubs which will tackle waits; they will be based at the Mater, Daisy Hill and South West Acute Hospitals. 
gain the title, the latter two hospitals have had to ""temporarily"" give up emergency general surgery.
By separating planned surgery from emergency surgery it's hoped waiting lists can be tackled and planned surgeries will not be affected by emergencies.  
Some of the public in Newry and the south west weren't convinced by the proposed changes - and in Fermanagh, they took to the streets in protest.
2022 has been a year of public inquiries including Muckamore, neurology, urology and the National Covid Inquiry. 
Rarely do inquiries yield the answers the public want, instead they tend to linger for years.
wo inquiries continue to dominate local headlines, hyponatraemia and neurology.  
In June the Neurology Inquiry found that the Belfast Trust failed to intervene quickly enough in the practice of a doctor which led to Northern Ireland's largest-ever patient recall. 
More than 5,000 former patients of neurologist Dr Michael Watt were invited to have their cases examined for possible misdiagnoses. 
quiry found numerous failures. 
A review of the clinical records of 44 patients who died under the care of Michael Watt found ""significant failures"" in their treatment and ""poor communication with families"".
regulator, the RQIA's Christine Collins, said the outcome of the review was ""shocking and gut-wrenching"". 
While that headline was vindication for families, within days they called for a police investigation.
Colin Armstrong's late mother, Ruth, was misdiagnosed by Michael Watt in 2001 and prescribed medication for epilepsy. 
He said the report was ""limited in its scope"" and was just the ""beginning of the work that needed to be done"".
Alan and Jennifer Roberts are another family who have said they have been let down by the health service. 
For 21 years they've sought justice for their daughter Claire's death in 1996 - this year a doctor involved in her care, Heather Steen was struck off - again the Roberts family have said this is just the start of legal action. 
It was another busy year for GPs as they were involved in the roll-out of boosters and flu vaccines.  
While many people said they had problems accessing one, Dr Frances O'Hagan told BBC News NI that the main reason was low staffing. 
umber of practices has fallen by about 9% and nine surgeries handed back their contracts.
Who can forget the happy face of five-year-old Daithi MacGabhann on the steps of Stormont after the legislation to bring opt-out organ donation was passed in February in Northern Ireland. 
It means people will automatically become donors unless they specifically state otherwise.  
As the year draws to a close there are flashbacks to 2019 when, like then, we are bang in the middle of industrial action by health workers over pay and conditions and there is no working government. 
me though strikes are happening at a national level and there is a cost-of-living crisis. 
In Northern Ireland, the executive ceased to function in October and a breakthrough seems a long way off. "
health	Plymouth schoolchildren campaign for better dental care	"Primary schoolchildren in Plymouth have launched a campaign to highlight a lack of NHS dental provision.
Pupils at Whitleigh Community Primary School launched their drive after teacher Sarah O'Neill surveyed parents.
Ms O'Neill said nearly 50% of children were not on the books of an NHS dentist, while more than a quarter of those who were couldn't get an appointment.
She added: ""It makes me really sad.""
r said she canvassed parents on access to dental care after she couldn't find a place for her own children.
She found the responses from more than 100 parents ""alarming"", she said.
""I grew up having six-monthly check-ups and making sure that my teeth were healthy and my mouth was healthy.""
""concerning"" results have sparked action in the classroom, with pupils launching a campaign to get better access, creating posters - and even penning a song demanding ""what's fair"".
Head teacher Gavin Summerfield said they were ""firm believers"" that children had the right to good dental care.
In August, a BBC investigation could not find a single dental practice in Devon taking on new adult NHS patients.
Nationwide, the survey found nine out of 10 practices asked were not taking on patients, including all 69 practices with NHS contracts contacted in Devon. Across the UK, eight out of 10 practices were refusing to take children.
Responding to the children's campaign, the British Dental Association said the government's NHS dental budget had ""for a decade"" failed to keep pace with inflation and population growth.   
Ahead of the Autumn Statement, the association's chairman Eddie Crouch said: ""Ministers need to wake up and listen to these parents.
""NHS dentistry is on the brink, but instead of support and investment, we're bracing ourselves for savage cuts. Our youngest patients will inevitably lose out.
""Tooth decay is the number one reason for hospital admissions among young children. Without urgent action the government will leave millions with no options."" 
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said improving access to primary care was a ""key priority"".
umber of dentists practising in the NHS had increased ""by more than 500"" last year and their work to improve access was backed by ""more than £3bn annually"".
: ""We have already started to make changes to the dental contract to incentivise dentists, paying more for complex work and enabling those with capacity to treat more patients, with further improvements to come.""

health	Neglect at Margate hospital contributed to death of doctor of 45 years, coroner says	"Neglect at an understaffed hospital contributed to the death of a doctor with 45 years' service, a coroner said. 
Dr David Gordon-Nesbitt, 84, was admitted to the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital in Margate on 21 October 2021 with a bowel obstruction.
A tube used to put dye into his stomach was clamped while an X-ray was taken, but was not unclamped afterwards. 
gestive juices were unable to drain away and his lungs filled with fluid.
He then developed sepsis and had a cardiac arrest, the family's lawyer said.
Dr Gordon-Nesbitt, a retired paediatrician, had an X-ray at 21:00 BST on 23 October and was returned to the ward.
North East Kent assistant coroner, Catherine Wood, told an inquest at Maidstone: ""The night shift on the ward he was on were short of qualified staff and there was no nurse in charge.""
Dr Gordon-Nesbitt started vomiting just after 01:00 but despite medical treatment he died at 04:00 BST the next day, the coroner said. 
""He died as a consequence of an acute aspiration of his gastric contents as a result of a bowel obstruction and contributed to by neglect,"" Ms Wood concluded. 
His daughter, Rebecca Gordon-Nesbitt, said: ""Dad was in really good health for a man his age. 
""There were too few experienced nursing staff available to work, and a dreadful mistake was made in his care.
""My father gave 45 years of his working life working for the NHS. It is horrifying that he should die like this.""
family's solicitor, Frankie Rhodes from Leigh Day, said: ""A finding of neglect in a case such as this is extremely rare.""
Sarah Shingler, executive chief nursing and midwifery officer for East Kent Hospitals, said: ""We apologise unreservedly to Mr Gordon-Nesbitt's family for the failings in his care.  
""We fully accept the findings and conclusion of the coroner and have employed more nurses, increased leadership support on each shift, and strengthened patient safety procedures on the ward.""

health	Nurses' strike: West Yorkshire staff walk out for second day of action	"Striking nurses in West Yorkshire say they have received strong public support as they take part in a second day of industrial action. 
Royal College of Nursing (RCN) members joined picket lines in Leeds and Bradford as part of a walkout across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
RCN says nurses deserve a pay rise of 19%, but the prime minister says such an increase would be unaffordable.
One nurse on a picket line in Bradford said: ""It's 99% support for us.""
Nurses at the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust and Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust are among those taking part in the strike. 
Emergency care will continue but routine services will be hit again. 
Among the striking staff stood outside Leeds General Infirmary, Julie Parkinson, a trauma and related services nurse, said: ""I've been a nurse for 37 years and I never thought I'd see the day.
""It's an incredibly sad day for the NHS and nurses, we should not be here, we need them to come to the table.
""It's not about us, it's about patients and it's about the state of our NHS. It's a war zone out there and we need support.""
Richard Deacon, from the RCN, said: ""I think nurses have been under so much pressure in recent years, particularly with the pandemic. 
""I think what we're showing here today is the strength of anger about how nurses feel they're being treated along with other healthcare workers too."" 
He added: ""Nurses' pay in real terms is 19% behind what they should be being paid had it kept up with inflation, that's why it's our demand now."" 
Outside Bradford Royal Infirmary, Jessica Smith, a 37-year-old staff nurse, said: ""We were nervous there might be some negative reactions from us being out here, but it's been nothing but positive. 
""We don't want to be out on strike, we've proved during the pandemic that we would leave our own families to take care of these patients - now it's time for them to recognise and respect us."" 
government has offered NHS staff in England and Wales a 4.75% pay increase.
Union sources have told the BBC that if there is no move to reopen pay talks, then new strike dates will be announced before Christmas with a series of walkouts likely in January.
Helen Peacock, a discharge co-ordinator at Bradford Royal Infirmary, said: ""It's a shame we've had to take this action again, obviously it affects the general public and that's not what we want at all.
""If the government will get round the table, [RCN general secretary] Pat Cullen has said she's willing to negotiate - she just wants to talk.""
50-year-old continued: ""It's 99% support for us, they understand why we're doing it and understand we wouldn't do it if we didn't feel we had to.""  
""It's disheartening that it has had to come to this but it needs to be done, if we don't make a stand now when do we make a stand?"" said Nasima Begum, a 40-year-old staff nurse at Bradford Royal Infirmary.
""I understand patients are waiting and Covid has delayed appointment times, but if we don't get better staffing now you're going to be waiting even longer."" 
re are more than 100 nurses standing outside Leeds General Infirmary on another brilliant blue-sky day.
me in just five days these nurses have walked away from the patients they care for and about.
Every time a car beeps a horn they cheer and wave placards, including some homemade ones saying things like ""some cuts don't heal"" and ""safe staffing saves lives"".
Many of the nurses are deeply torn about going on strike but say this is about protecting the workforce and patients.
government says the pay offer is fair but those here don't see it that way. 
weather for this second strike is warmer than the first but this dispute shows no sign on thawing.
rike means routine care such as knee and hip replacements are likely to be affected. 
However, life-saving treatment must be provided and anyone who is ill or seriously injured should still call 999, or 111 for non-urgent care.
Hospitals in Bradford and Leeds which are affected by the strike have said urgent and emergency care will be prioritised. 
Anyone with hospital appointments should attend as normal, unless they have been contacted in advance by the hospital.

health	Bournemouth: Anti-abortion group take action against clinic buffer zone	"An anti-abortion group is taking legal action over a clinic buffer zone, claiming it censors free speech and criminalises reading from the Bible.
Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council is being taken to court for introducing the zone to protect staff and visitors from protests.
Christian Concern said the council's consultation held prior to its introduction was ""questionable"". 
BCP Council said it was seeking legal advice and considering its position.
Supported by the Christian Legal Centre, the group said the 492ft (150m) buffer zone around the British Pregnancy Advisory Group's (BPAS) clinic in Ophir Road in Bournemouth, makes prayer illegal. 
group said the zone had ""essentially criminalised"" volunteer members of 40 Days for Life for offering help and support within the area. 
It said ""sprinkling 'holy water' in the zone, could lead to a volunteer facing six months in prison"".
It said it would pursue a statutory review of the council's decision to ""force through a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) in October following a questionable public consultation."" 
Its lawyers will argue that whilst the council actively engaged with BPAS during the consultation, it did not consult with any anti-abortion group, including 40 Days for Life.
It said its lawyers will also argue that the PSPO is disproportionate and will ask the High Court to declare the PSPO is ""unlawful, unjustified and an interference with pro-lifers' rights"".
In October MPs voted for an amendment to the Public Order Bill which will impose buffer zones around all abortion clinics in England and Wales.
But the group cited the position of Minister for Women, Maria Caulfield, who voiced her opposition to the move.
Andrea Williams, chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre, said: ""Buffer zones are an oppressive part of the current culture which force consent and silence dissent.""
BCP Council confirmed it had recently received notice of a legal challenge to the PSPO order surrounding the clinic and that it was seeking legal advice and considering its position.

health	World's longest Covid sufferer stages come-back gig in Bristol	"""miracle man"" who was infected with Covid for more than 10 months has staged a come-back concert with some help from the English National Opera. 
Dave Smith, from Bristol, had Covid for nearly 300 days - longer than anyone else recorded in the world. 
73-year-old was hospitalised seven times and said he had ""resigned"" himself to dying. 
But now the life-long musician is back on stage after some breath coaching from a professional opera singer. 
Mr Smith described his experience of getting Covid in May 2020 as ""like someone has pulled the plug and life is just draining out of your body"".
He lost 10 stone (63.5kg) during his illness and was left barely able to walk or hold a conversation.
Mr Smith, a driving instructor by day and a lead singer by night, was finally cured after being offered a cocktail of antiviral drugs developed by a company in the US last summer.  
Mr Smith's road to full recovery has been slow, and in the past year he has been admitted to hospital several times for breathing problems. 
He can only do a few minutes of activity before sitting down, and until recently he was unable to do the thing he missed most in the world - singing. 
Describing what performing again would mean to him before the course, Mr Smith told BBC Breakfast: ""It would be like having my complete life back, I know I have got my physical life back but it would be my mental life as well.""
He joked that when he sang he felt like a ""squeezebox with all the air squeezed out"". 
Mr Smith was thrown a lifeline after being accepted onto a six-week breath work course developed by Suzie Zumpe of the English National Opera (EN) in partnership with Imperial College London. 
Over 90% of people who take part say they have noticed an improvement in their symptoms and they would recommend it to other sufferers.
Jenny Mollica, director of ENO Breathe, said: ""We know that opera singers are used to filling big auditoriums with their voice completely unamplified, so they understand breath control, they understand the physiology of breathing.
""What we are doing is working with some of that expertise to give them skills and strategies to manage their breathlessness post-Covid.""
By Jon Kay
When I first met the retired driving-instructor in Bristol in June 2021, he had finally recovered from Covid after having the active virus in his body for more than 300 days - longer than anyone else on the planet. 
He was still very frail and his lungs were badly damaged. 
He could only walk a few steps before he needed to rest and he told me the thing he missed the most was singing. 
For years, Dave had performed in pubs and clubs around Bristol, but it seemed his gigging days were over. 
However, this autumn we filmed his progress for BBC Breakfast as he took part in online singing lessons through the ENO Breathe course for the NHS. 
Dave was a little perplexed at first - some of the vocal exercises were ""a bit weird"" he said - but, over six weeks, the techniques he learned seemed to lead to a marked improvement in his lung capacity and his confidence. 
It wasn't long before he decided he could fulfil his dream of getting back up on stage and performing with his band. 
gig itself was one of the best I've ever been to. 
Not because of the music itself - Dave still struggles a bit with his voice - but the goodwill and love for Dave in the room was extraordinary. 
Mr Smith said when doctors told him he only had 51% of his lung capacity, he thought his singing days were over. 
But within weeks of finishing his breath course, he was planning his comeback. 
He said then: ""I'm pretty sure I can do it, singing makes you feel really happy and when it goes well it's such a buzz. The endorphins get going. It's absolutely brilliant.""
Mr Smith and his band booked the Langley Arms pub near Bristol and on the night of the performance it was packed with friends and family. 
raised some money for Southmead Hospital, where Mr Smith was treated, with a Christmas raffle.  
His idol, Francis Rossi of Status Quo, even had a few words of advice. 
rock star told Mr Smith ""to think of it as 'just another gig, that way you can do you and enjoy it. It will be fun.
Mr Smith said the call ""boosted me right up"".
Mr Smith's wife Lynda said: ""You never would have thought it would have been possible - two years ago he was at death's door five times. 
""He was determined to do it.""
Step-son Rich Nicholls said: ""He wasn't able to walk. We had to get the stair lift in just for him to be able to get upstairs. 
""He could barely hold a conversation without being out of breath. It's amazing.""
Suzie Zumpe of the ENO even showed up to do a duet.
Speaking after the gig, Mr Smith said: ""It was great. It was a real rush and the crowd was behind me. I'm not 100% and it's taken it out of me.
""It'll probably be my last performance ever.""

health	How China's Covid protests are being silenced	"China's censorship machine is going to great lengths to prevent people seeing scenes of protest in multiple Chinese cities. 
Demonstrations erupted across the country at the weekend in response to strict anti-Covid measures that have been in place for three years. 
An ever-growing list of words that reference the protests are being censored, and attempts are being made to deflect the narrative on both domestic and overseas platforms. 
rare widespread protests began after ten people died last week in a fire in the city of Urumqi. Many believe residents could not escape the blaze because of Covid restrictions, but authorities have disputed this.
As is generally the case with protests in China - even small-scale ones - Chinese media have made no mention of them. Reports on the country's Covid outbreak over the last few days have been muted, with outlets choosing to focus on upbeat stories like China's latest achievements in space.  
f protest posted on platforms like Twitter, and widely shared internationally, are being ignored by state media outlets.
king about the latest anti-Covid protests, the words ""Shanghai"" and ""Urumqi"" - cities where residents have protested - have been added to a list of censored search terms by platforms like Weibo. Whereas before they showed tens of millions of results on the Chinese social media platform, now they only show hundreds. 
In an attempt to bypass the censorship, people began using terms like ""white paper"" and ""A4"" - a reference to the pieces of bland paper that have become a symbol of the protests. But now even these have become censored search terms on Weibo. 
Far from being deterred, creative social media users are finding new ways to show their solidarity with protestors. They discuss ""A3"" paper instead, and have referenced historic social media trends that mention paper, like the ""A4 skinny waist challenge"". 
One of the most common ways Chinese social media users get messages out is by posting on foreign social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. 
re blocked in mainland China and are only accessible with a piece of software known as a VPN. But some nevertheless have taken to these platforms to highlight demonstrations that have taken place. 
Overseas Chinese have also staged protests outside Chinese embassies, lighting candles and holding blank pieces of paper. 
re scenes that the Communist Party government would rather people - especially overseas Chinese - didn't see. 
Consequently, there has been a large-scale attempt to flood platforms like Twitter with porn and gambling content using the hashtags #Urumqi and #Shanghai, to stop people searching for footage of the protests. 
China has a history of this. During the 2019 Hong Kong protests, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube said they witnessed a co-ordinated attempt by the government to spread disinformation on their channels, and this led to hundreds of accounts and posts being removed.  
While state media for now appear intent on ignoring the protests, there are early signs that they might shape a narrative where foreigners are to blame for scenes of unrest, should they escalate. 
Some are already taking to social media blaming foreigners for instigating the protests.
State media have repeatedly criticised the West for its more lax Covid-19 rules and warned against countries buying into what they see as US rhetoric.
But seeing the rest of the world celebrate in Qatar has fuelled local anger this week. Consequently, China's broadcaster CCTV has moved to avoid showing spectators enjoying matches in its own coverage.  
In addition to this, China introduced eased Covid-19 measures earlier this month. These involved reducing the length of quarantine, making it easier for people to enter the country for short periods of time.
So potentially it will become easier to blame foreigners for the spread of the virus as well. Cases have spiralled to record levels in recent weeks, with more than 40,000 recorded on Monday.
And with no end in sight to China's zero-Covid policy, there is a very realistic possibility of more protests. The number of lockdowns have only increased over the last month, as anybody who tests positive, and their close contacts, are still under orders to quarantine. This hasn't changed since the early stages of the pandemic and people are increasingly frustrated. 
It wouldn't be the first time that China had blamed the West for dissent at home. Hong Kong's 2019 protests - the last large-scale demonstrations in China - were blamed on ""violent extremists"" being influenced by ""Western lackeys""."
health	Hampshire: No hospital beds as critical incident reinstated	"re are no beds available at three hospitals in Hampshire, forcing the NHS to reinstate critical incidents across the county.
Hospitals in Andover, Basingstoke and Winchester are all full, Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (HHFT) said.
Nearly all other hospital beds were occupied, the region's NHS Integrated Care Board said. 
It warned patients could face delays in receiving care.
HHFT said its three hospitals have about 100 Covid patients, a ""comparable and rising number of flu cases and a high number of medically-fit people waiting to be discharged"".
""Health and care services throughout Hampshire and the Isle of Wight are currently experiencing incredibly high demand,"" NHS's Integrated Care Board's chief nursing officer Nicky Lucey said.
""We recognise during this period of significant pressure that it is not always possible to give this care as quickly as we would like.""
rd said urgent treatment centres, GP practices, minor injuries units and ambulance services were all experiencing ""incredible pressure"".
It appealed to people to obtain flu jabs and to liaise with hospitals about relatives who are ready to be discharged.
Five out of seven NHS trusts in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight were on critical incident alerts due to winter pressures, the NHS reported on 20 December.
ree of the trusts - Hampshire Hospitals, Portsmouth University Hospitals and South Central Ambulance Service - stood down the alert status on 22 and 23 December.
Critical incidents are also currently in force in neighbouring Dorset, Sussex and other parts of England.
Hospital trusts declare a critical incident when they are worried they are on the brink of not being able to provide critical services, such as emergency care.
It paves the way for measures to be taken, such as redeployment of staff.
NHS England said 3,746 patients were in hospital last week with flu.

health	RSV and flu surge in US ahead of holidays – what to know	"With the holiday season approaching in the US, doctors are urging people to exercise caution to avoid a surge in common and potentially dangerous winter viruses.
US is facing a rise in cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with some hospitals opening extra beds to treat patients, while there are concerns about other illnesses such as flu.
Winnie Chow, a parent to 10-month-old Cooper, took her son to hospital earlier this month after he had been vomiting and coughing for several days. He spent four days there recovering from RSV.
""I was in tears,"" said Ms Chow, who lives in Hackensack, New Jersey. ""For him to be there for more than a day was very scary.""
Ms Chow is one of many parents who have had to seek care for an unwell child as winter viruses arrive earlier and with more severity than in recent years - a trend experts say could persist as people gather indoors for the winter holidays.
""We do worry when people start gathering,"" said Richard Malley, a senior physician with the Division of Infectious Disease at Boston Children's Hospital in Massachusetts. 
""When you have multiple generations mingling together, you have an increased risk of transmission from someone who is handling the virus pretty well to someone who may not handle it well at all.""
RSV can manifest like a common cold in adults, but can prove dangerous for some young children.
Symptoms include a cough, congestion, runny nose and fever as well as wheezing in young infants, according to Rachel Orscheln, the director of ambulatory paediatric infectious diseases at St Louis Children's Hospital.
For the most vulnerable, RSV can lead to bronchiolitis, a condition that includes a build-up of inflammation in the lungs and difficulty breathing. There is no vaccine for RSV but scientists are working on developing one.
It can be difficult to distinguish between RSV, coronavirus and the flu because the respiratory viruses include many of the same symptoms and usually peak in winter.
But physicians can use tests to diagnose patients to determine the best course of treatment.
Parents should reach out to their child's healthcare provider if they begin to have concerns, especially if they are experiencing worsening symptoms, difficulty breathing or are struggling to drink fluids, said Sonali Advani, an assistant professor of medicine at Duke University's Division of Infectious Diseases.
Experts say protective measures like social distancing, mask wearing and other hygiene practices from the coronavirus pandemic likely shielded some children from exposure to the flu and their first RSV infection, which most children normally experience by age two. 
means they may now be more vulnerable to infection.
An earlier RSV season followed by more severe flu infections has created a ""perfect storm"" that is ""flooding our paediatric capacity"", said Daniel Rauch, the chief of Paediatric Hospital Medicine at Tufts Medicine in Massachusetts. 
He told the BBC a reduction in hospital beds for children during the coronavirus pandemic, which was intended to make space for adults who are more vulnerable to severe illness from Covid, had worsened the current problem.
Some experts said they were not optimistic the issues would resolve soon, as close contact during the the winter holiday season could offer more opportunities for viral transmission. 
Getting vaccinated against Covid and the flu offers one of the best forms of protection against some of the respiratory illnesses that are circulating, experts told the BBC.
US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci said the flu jab was ""well matched"" to the circulating strain, while White House Covid co-ordinator Dr Ashish Jha urged Americans to ""make protecting our loved ones an important part of the conversation we have around the Thanksgiving table"".
king a rapid test for Covid on the morning of winter holiday celebrations adds another potential layer of protection, Dr Malley said. 
He added that parents could also make sure any person serving food during large family gatherings is symptom-free and handling the food in a hygienic manner. 
Handwashing and avoiding touching your face and mouth are also advised.
""If you're sick, maybe skip the family gathering this year,"" Dr Rauch said. ""Don't bring it to everybody else.""
Parents and children should also wear masks during travel on planes, trains and other public transportation and could do so during gatherings where they are unsure others are vaccinated, Dr Rauch said. 
In the meantime, Amy Knight, the president of the Children's Hospital Association which represents more than 220 hospitals across the US, said paediatric hospitals were ""getting creative"" and finding extra space for patients while working to keep conditions as normal as possible.
""No one likes to have a sick child,"" she said.
""It's an incredibly stressful time, but many have also been understanding in recognising that the hospital has a big challenge and a big job, and they're grateful to be there and grateful to have the care.""

health	Dr Heather Steen to be removed from medical register	"A senior doctor is to be removed from the medical register after she was found to have attempted to cover-up the circumstances of a young girl's death.
Paediatrics consultant Dr Heather Steen was found to be unfit to practise after an investigation into the death of nine-year-old Claire Roberts in 1996.
A medical tribunal examining the doctor's case ruled that the majority of allegations against her were true.
Claire's mother said it was ""just the start of getting full justice"".
""I am angry at Dr Steen for putting us through 26 years of mental torment,"" said Jennifer Roberts.
""When we look back that night [when Claire died] we put our trust in doctors.
Jennifer Roberts says she is ""relieved and angry"" after the tribunal ruling
""We left Claire that night thinking we would see her in the morning.
""I will never forgive her.""
Mrs Roberts described her daughter as ""fun-loving, happy and full of energy"".
At the time of Claire's death, her parents were told she had a viral infection that had spread from her stomach to her brain.
But in 2018 a public inquiry determined that she had died from an overdose of fluids and medication caused by negligent care at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children.
quiry also concluded there had been ""cover up"" and the girl's death had not been referred to the coroner immediately to ""avoid scrutiny"".
Dr Steen had previously been found by the General Medical Council (GMC) to have acted dishonestly in trying to conceal the circumstances of Claire's death.
Dr Steen denied the allegations from the GMC.
was then put to the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS), which rules on doctors' fitness to practise.
When the case reached the tribunal stage Dr Steen twice applied to be voluntarily removed from the medical register and was twice refused.
Had that been successful the tribunal would have been halted as she would no longer have been a doctor.
However the tribunal continued and examined allegations that between October 1996 and May 2006 Dr Steen ""knowingly and dishonestly carried out several actions to conceal the true circumstances"" of Claire.
ribunal concluded that many of the allegations against her were true, including:
Some of the allegations against her were not proved.
Claire Roberts's parents Alan and Jennifer took on the system - the Belfast Health Trust and the Department of Health - and they won.
quiet, unassuming couple have fought for justice over the past 26 years.
While Jennifer has cried many tears, Alan has told their story with tremendous composure and compassion.

With dignity they attended the Hyponatraemia Inquiry, which examined the deaths of five children in hospitals, including Claire's.
It was the longest-running medical inquiry in UK history.

For years their lives have been dominated by news about Claire.
r gave up. Their determination to get justice and to fight the system has been mammoth.
While the decision to remove Dr Steen from the medical register is a milestone, Claire's mum and dad say their fight will continue until everyone is held to account.
In its ruling, the tribunal said it took into account that ""Dr Steen's dishonesty persisted between 2004 and 2006, culminating in her knowingly giving inaccurate evidence to the coroner's inquest into Claire Roberts' death"".
ribunal said that was done to conceal the true circumstances of the death.
It also said Dr Steen's dishonesty extended to concealing from Claire's parents the true circumstances of her death, despite their desire to discover what had happened to their daughter.
ribunal said fellow practitioners would consider Dr Steen's behaviour in seeking to cover up the cause of Claire Roberts' death to be deplorable.
It concluded that Dr Steen's fitness to practise was ""impaired by reason of misconduct"".
ribunal also ruled that Dr Steen's immediate removal from the medical register was in the public interest."
health	Why we should worry about what is happening in A&E	"A&E waiting time figures are once again the worst on record.
In the week ending 27 November just 61.9% of patients attending emergency departments were dealt with within the four-hour target.
And the problem is far more acute at Scotland's busiest A&Es.
risis in A&E shows what is happening across the whole system.
Separately, the number of hospital beds occupied by people who are medically well enough to go home is also at a record high.
means patients can't get into hospital because there are no beds and they can't get out because there is not enough social care. 
ressure this causes seeps into every single part of the system. 
Staff are stressed and burnt out while patients are at risk because they can't access the care they need. 
It is pretty obvious that when you are very ill, waiting for a long time in an emergency department is not a good idea.  
You only need to look at social media to see regular posts from A&E staff who describe how stressful and dangerous they feel things are. 
I get regular calls from emergency medicine doctors telling me they are in despair and can't cope with the relentless demand.
One consultant told me that they are taking more and more risks. 
g ensured a patient is not facing a life-threatening situation they are making the call that it is probably better to send them home to follow-up with their GP.
rnative could be the patient languishing on a trolley in a brightly-lit corridor for many hours before a bed becomes free. 
In Glasgow, doctors who feel they cannot speak publicly have talked me through the pattern of their daily handovers. They say phrases such as ""an unsafe environment"", ""no available resus (resuscitation) beds"" and ""patient's life is at risk"" are routinely documented.  
rs say they have seen patients die simply because they could not get to them in time. 
Last week the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) in Glasgow recorded its worst ever performance for A&E. Only 35.1% were attended to within four hours. The latest figures were only slightly better.
Scotland's busiest A&E - Edinburgh Royal Infirmary - and Forth Valley Royal near Falkirk have both had more than six out of every 10 patients waiting more than four hours.
Some days were even worse than the stats show.
A performance chart shared with me shows that at the QEUH, on Saturday 19 November, of 233 patients who showed up at the emergency department, only 21.9% of patients were seen within the target time.
One internal document I have been shown makes reference to 11 ambulances queued outside the hospital when there were no available spaces in A&E, which was four nurses and a consultant down. 
Some of the proposals outlined to stop ambulances getting stuck outside the hospital include offloading patients into corridors. 
One doctor spells it out - if this was an operating theatre, the staff would simply not be allowed to carry out surgery because it is not safe. But A&E can't close. 
""There needs to be a full inquiry into what is happening in our emergency departments,"" they say.
Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) has long said that delays in A&E lead to people dying unnecessarily.
It carried out research that suggests there could be one avoidable death for every 72 patients waiting between eight and 12 hours in A&E.
monthly figures show that in October there were 15,467 patients who waited more than eight hours.
re were 6,814 who waited more than 12 hours.
Both of these figures are record highs and, according to RCEM calculations, could be resulting in as many as 200 avoidable deaths in a month.
Last month the BBC revealed documents that showed senior health board leaders were concerned unscheduled care was ""going to fall over in the near-term before planned care falls over"". 
Minutes of a meeting of Scotland's NHS leaders in September show ideas on how to address this include discharging people from hospital after 23 hours.  
NHS is not actually overwhelmed, with the number of people arriving at hospital not radically different to any other time.  
real issue, they say, is delayed discharge - getting people home when they no longer need acute hospital care. 
But to fix that requires a radical improvement in social care and access to community health care. 
rge figures show that in October the average number of beds occupied by people who no longer need hospital care was 1,898, the highest figure since the current guidance came into place in July 2016.
As many as one in every six beds in a hospital is occupied by a patient who is medically ready to go home but can't. 
Of course it is not always straightforward to discharge patients who no longer require treatment in hospital. They may need major adjustments to their home if they can no longer manage stairs, for example, or need carers to help them dress, shower or eat. 
One doctor in Lanarkshire told me that things are so bad now, they can assess a patient on one shift and come back 24 hours later to find that same patient still in A&E waiting for a bed. That is despite the board adding extra beds into wards to try to increase capacity in their hospital to admit new patients.
As I said at the start, what is happening at A&E reflects the health of the whole system.
A nurse working in Edinburgh told me there can be many tears on a shift but staff support each other, pick themselves up and get on with the next shift. 
Patients are deeply frustrated they can't get through to their GP, or spend hours on the phone after dialling 111 - so they end up at A&E.  
Meanwhile health boards continue to call for patients to avoid coming unless it is a life threatening emergency. 
None of this shows signs of getting any better, any time soon. "
health	West Midlands GP calls for better support for veterans	"Doctor Robin Simpson said he did not want veterans to be disadvantaged by their service to the country
A former Army doctor has urged GP surgeries to sign up to a scheme to give military veterans better support and care.
Robin Simpson's own practice in Hampton in Arden, near Solihull, West Midlands, has become a ""veteran friendly"" surgery.
Royal College of GPs scheme gives them access to specialised guidance and training about what veterans may need.
""My vision is to improve the healthcare of veterans,"" he said.
m O'Sullivan served in Afghanistan as an Army reservist in 2007 and found last year's withdrawal of troops brought back painful memories. 
He said he was struggling to process them and turned to Mr Simpson's surgery for help.
""I came to speak to my GP who actually was incredibly understanding and got me some really good help very quickly,"" he said.
More than 1,300 practices in England have signed up to the scheme, according to the Royal College of GPs.
Former RAF pilot John Bransbury also uses the Hampton in Arden surgery and said it was a comfort knowing they understood his background.
""I think it's an excellent, excellent idea, really, to make GPs aware of the different circumstances under which service people actually work,"" he added.

health	Urology: Aidan O'Brien's patients 'missed out on essential care'	"An inquiry into the clinical practice of a consultant urologist has heard how he refused to involve specialist cancer care nurses on his team.
A senior cancer specialist said patients under Mr Aidan O'Brien's care at Craigavon Area Hospital missed out due to the ""luck of the draw"".
All other patients received this care, the specialist said.
quiry is examining Mr O'Brien's work at the Southern Health trust between January 2019 and June 2020.
Earlier in November, the inquiry heard that almost 600 patients received ""suboptimal care"" as his patients.
Dr Dermot Hughes was involved in a review of nine serious incidents involving the urologist.
He told the inquiry he found it unusual that cancer care nurses were not involved in any of his cases.
Dr Hughes said that, in his experience, it was normal practice for care to be shared and that cancer care nurses were integral.
""That way, there is seamless care - so there is a clinical care nurse specialist either to support the patient or to be with the patient or to inform the patient of their illness,"" said Dr Hughes.
""In my experience, the professional giving the care should be the person referring the patient to the clinical care specialist. 
""But the issue here in the Southern Trust is that, clearly, Mr O'Brien did not work with clinical work specialists in his oncology clinics. 
""He did not involve them in the classic roles of cancer nurse specialists in terms of holistic assessment, informing patients of their disease and discussing their options.""
Dr Hughes said his reviews found that this situation had been raised by nurses with the trust but that it had failed to act.   
""The practice in the Southern Trust was that all other patients received this care in tandem with their consultant, but a separate cohort did not,"" he said.
""That issue was known but not dealt with.""
quiry, chaired by Christine Smith KC, also heard from urologist Mr Hugh Gilbert who worked in the review team with Dr Hughes. 
He described the benefits of having a care nurse assigned for cancer patients undergoing treatment, saying ""it continuously allows the patient access to information and support"".
""It just so happens that the best-placed person for that is a cancer nurse specialist as they have not only knowledge of the medical aspects of care but also in the nursing aspects of care which are fundamental to a patient's wellbeing,"" said Mr Gilbert.
""At the time of discussion (of a patient's diagnosis), a key worker is appointed and that is usually, almost inevitably, a cancer nurse specialist. 
""They are named and their name is put on all printed materials.""
Dr Hughes said families were concerned to learn from the review team that their relatives were being treated differently and missed out on vital support.
""The role of the cancer nurse specialist really is essential.
""It is informative; patients receive better experience and the families found it difficult to know that the majority of patients received this and their cohort did not.
""The care that is delivered by those nurses in the Southern Trust was exemplary. 
""But for these patients it was the luck of the draw because they were allocated a particular professional, they didn't get this service.""
Mr O'Brien worked at the Southern Health Trust from 1992 until his retirement in July 2020.
He was temporarily excluded from the workplace in 2017 before returning under supervision.
quiry's role is to examine the clinical and corporate governance of the Southern Health Trust."
health	China deactivates national Covid tracking app	"China has deactivated a phone app that has tracked people's movements during the pandemic.
, which has been operational for three years, went offline at the end of Monday.
It is the latest policy change that signals Beijing is abandoning its controversial zero-Covid strategy. 
move is highly symbolic but will not have a huge impact on people's daily lives because of the local apps still in use in cities across China.
-run Communications Itinerary Card app, which uses phone signals to track whether someone has travelled to an area considered to be high-risk, was seen as a central part of China's zero-Covid policy. 
People were required to enter phone numbers in the app in order to produce a green arrow indicating they were able to travel between provinces and enter events.
Now travel between provinces has been eased with the removal of Covid-prevention restrictions, the national app has been deemed to be obsolete by officials.
Many social media users in China have welcomed the app's retirement. 
But it is only one of several tracking apps that have governed everyday life in China, with many people still using scanning systems run by their city or province to access local amenities and public buildings.
ge is symbolic for a nation which is turning away from its controversial zero-Covid strategy following widespread protests in several cities. 
Recent unrest was triggered by a fire in a high-rise block in the western Xinjiang region that killed 10 people in November, with long-running restrictions blamed for hampering the rescue effort.
Following policy changes, people with Covid can now isolate at home rather than in state facilities, and there has been a broad relaxation of mass testing. 
China is now experiencing a surge in Covid cases, with authorities in Beijing saying more than 22,000 patients had visited hospitals across the city on Sunday - 16 times the number a week earlier.
China reported 8,626 domestic cases on Sunday, but with testing no longer widespread the numbers are believed to be much higher.
Despite its loosening of measures, China is still regarded as having some of the most hard-line Covid restrictions in the world. "
health	Devon and Cornwall NHS facing 'unbelievable pressure'	"A man from Devon who had to wait more than 13 hours for an ambulance says the NHS is under ""unbelievable pressure"".
Paramedics were called when Geoff Clapp, of East Prawle in the South Hams, suffered a suspected blood clot on the lungs in September.
Mr Clapp said he had to wait nine hours to be admitted to A&E and then spent a further 24 hours in a corridor on a hospital trolley.
NHS England said staff were working ""round-the-clock"".
Nationally, the latest figures show nearly 40% of A&E patients who need admitting face a delay of four hours or more waiting for a bed to be found.
Prof Adrian Harris, from the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, said Covid, more patients and staff recruitment issues had caused a ""perfect storm"". 
He added: ""These are the most challenging circumstances we find ourselves in.
""We're recovering from Covid - and Covid has added complexity. We're in winter and we're seeing a greater flow of patients than we've ever seen.""
Speaking about his experience at Derriford Hospital, Mr Clapp said there was ""something inherently wrong"" with the system.
In addition to waiting for an ambulance, he said he spent 24 hours on a trolley in the hospital corridor alongside other patients, one of whom was 98.
""They are just completely overawed by the volume of patients and the volume of work,"" he said.
""It was the ambulance staff that were looking after us in the corridors... [they] were dedicated to looking after patients before they actually got into the hospital itself.""
He praised the professionalism of NHS staff but said they have ""a lot to put up with"".
""We're not living in a Third World country are we?"" he said.
""There must be something inherently wrong somewhere. I don't think it's the nursing staff at all but they are under unbelievable pressure. 
""You really wonder how they cope.""
South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust apologised for the delay in reaching Mr Clapp.
""Our ambulance clinicians strive every day to give their best to patients but our performance has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, partly due to handover delays at emergency departments,"" a spokeswoman said.
""Health and social care services are under enormous pressure. We are working with our partners in the NHS and social care to do all we can to improve the service that patients receive.""
University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust said demand for care was exceeding capacity.
""While we are unable to comment on individual patient cases, we apologise that patients are experiencing long waits,"" the trust said.
""This is not a situation we want for any of our patients and our dedicated staff are working extremely hard to make sure patients are seen in order of clinical need.""
Nationally the NHS waiting list has hit a record high while A&E departments experienced their worst performance on record against a four-hour target, new figures show.
Data from NHS England shows nationally 7.2m people were waiting to start routine treatment at the end of October, up from 7.1m in September and the highest number since records began in August 2007.
Dr Vin Diwakar, of NHS England, said staff were working ""round-the-clock"" to try to see and treat patients as quickly as they could.

remony, which took place in October at a temple inside the institute, was attended by ministers and lawmakers of Tamil Nadu state. 
Dr Poorna Chandrika, the director of IMH, says it was like a ""family marriage"" for them.

health	NHS strike: Health workers 'not able to make ends meet' on current pay	"Health sector workers from three of Northern Ireland's biggest unions are taking part in a strike on Monday, in a dispute over pay and conditions.
Members from Unison, Nipsa and GMB in all areas of the health service are taking part in a 24-hour strike.
It is the first strike in the health service since 2019.
Health workers have been told they will receive a 2022-23 pay award of £1,400 but unions argue it is not enough.

health	How Covid has dealt the NHS a lasting blow	"NHS in England has more funding and staff than before the pandemic - but in many types of care, it is treating fewer patients. Why? A leading think tank has tried to come up with some answers.
Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says this is a puzzle with no simple explanation - but the pandemic has dealt a lasting blow to the NHS and it could be costing more to treat patients, on average, than before.
Despite higher staff sickness rates, compared with pre-pandemic levels, the NHS has available to work:
But - not counting those filled by patients who have tested positive for Covid, even though they may be there mainly for something else -  there were 5% fewer beds available in the third quarter of this year than in 2019, the IFS says. The impact of the virus has lasted longer than expected. 
It is also harder to discharge medically fit patients because of problems with community care.  
And evidence, such as rising numbers of disability-benefit claimants, suggests there are more ill patients needing complex care.
monthly data shows 4% more GP appointments in England than in the same month in 2019, which is ""particularly striking"" as the number of fully qualified general practitioners has fallen, the IFS says.
re were also more first cancer hospital outpatient appointments - but fewer overall and the number of patients treated from the waiting list, currently 7.2 million in England, was down 11%.
f NHS finances has been well documented and the report says the real value of the current spending plans has been reduced by inflation.
IFS research economist Max Warner says: ""The NHS is showing clear signs of strain heading into the winter and is treating fewer patients than it was pre-pandemic, across many types of care. 
""The real risk, almost three years on from the start of the pandemic, is that the Covid hit to NHS performance is not time-limited. 
""Going forward, we need to grapple with the possibility that the health service is just able to treat fewer patients with the same level of resources.""
A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""As the IFS report acknowledges, Covid had a significant impact on the NHS, and we are focused on delivering the biggest catch-up programme in health history"".
NHS had reduced waits of 18 months by 60% in a year and ""virtually eliminated"" waits of more than two years.
""We're allocating an extra £500 million to speed up hospital discharge, getting ambulances back on the road more quickly, and increasing the number of NHS call handlers.""
f a series of IFS reports. 
first found the NHS was doing less than before the pandemic, despite more staff and funding.
But this one is designed to highlight the complexities and mitigating factors, concluding there are significant long-term changes to the health and care landscape worthy of further investigation."
politics	Would pay demands cost an extra £28bn?	"Faced with a wave of strikes this winter, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was asked what more he could do to head them off.
Mr Sunak said the government had accepted the recommendations of the public sector pay review bodies but added: ""What I'm not going to do is ask ordinary families up and down the country to pay an extra £1,000 a year to meet the pay demands of the union bosses.""
Health Secretary Steve Barclay has also used this figure, telling BBC Breakfast on 7 December: ""If everyone in the public sector had a pay rise in line with inflation, it would cost an extra £28bn, an extra £1,000 per household.""
But, in terms of the current dispute, these figures look too high. 
ublic sector pay bill for all 5.7 million employees was around £233bn last year.
Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts average inflation for 2022-23 of about 10%. A rise for public sector workers in line with this would cost about £23bn.
re are 28 million households in the UK, so that's about £820 per household.
But there's something else to consider, as Ben Zaranko from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has pointed out.
""The government was already planning to give non-zero pay awards when it set out its spending plans last autumn,"" he told Reality Check.
It was already budgeting for a 3% average pay rise for the public sector for 2022-23 - remember, both the prime minister and the health secretary talked about how much ""extra"" would have to be paid. 
Once this is factored in, the IFS estimates that increasing it to match inflation of 10% would cost about £18bn - around £640 per household. 
And there's also the question of the tax public sector workers would be paying if they got an inflation-linked pay deal.
If it cost the government £18bn, it would be getting some of this back through tax - roughly a third - bringing the bill down further.
On 7 December, we asked the Treasury how it came up with the £28bn and £1,000 per family (or household) figures. 
On 9 December, it said they were calculated for an inflation-linked pay deal in 2023-24, whereas our calculations are for 2022-23.
government got to its higher figure by:
We asked the government why its figures were for 2023-24, when the strikes and disputes are over pay settlements in the current year?
It said these were appropriate given that pay has been set for this year and we are nine months through the pay year for most workforces.
But some questions remain:
Why is the government taking an inflation figure from October 2022 and applying it to a pay deal in 2023-24?
Ben Zaranko, from the IFS, points out that CPI inflation is forecast by the OBR to average 5.5% in 2023/24. 
""So it doesn't make sense to apply the current rate of CPI inflation to a pay award next year"", he told us.
He suggested that the right number to use, under the government's methodology, would be ""more like £14 billion"".
And why would families be asked to pay ""an extra £1,000 a year""?
We don't know quite what Mr Sunak means by this. 
If he means an extra £1,000 in tax to fund this pay deal, it's worth pointing out that taxes such as income tax and national insurance are not evenly distributed throughout the population.
Some families don't pay any and the amount of tax paid by those who do, varies widely.

politics	Don't believe it's back to boring, says Laura Kuenssberg	"After the last few years - let alone the last few weeks - you can see why Michael Gove has said in a speech that he is grateful ""boring is back"". 
Mr Gove, who has returned to cabinet as levelling up secretary and appears on this week's programme, made the comments at the London Press Club awards.
You too might feel relief that the crazy period of the Truss administration has come to an end, and that in Rishi Sunak we seem to have a prime minister who doesn't revel in scrapes and scandals, who doesn't have making headlines at the top of his to-do list. Now who might we be talking about?  
One of his ministers told me that Sunak had ""ended the Tory psychodrama with a careful reshuffle of all the talents and a focus on delivery"", saying it was a sign of the recent turmoil that commentators see that as ""boring"". ""It's actually serious government,"" they added.
Another of his MPs, who did not find a berth in government, had a less flattering assessment, saying: ""He's managed to appoint to some of the dullest people in Parliament to ministerial jobs, so if anybody can succeed in being boring, it's some of these people."" Ouch!  
It is true that we are at the start of a very different era. From 2015 until last month at least one of our big political parties has been led by a deeply unconventional leader.
Jeremy Corbyn's time in office turned Labour upside down. Boris Johnson as the Tory boss provided a daily soap opera. 
Much of the soundtrack to the last seven years has been noisy internal chaos for one - or sometimes both - of Labour and the Conservatives.  
Sunak vs Starmer creates a different atmosphere altogether. The biggest beasts in our politics are now described by colleagues as ""sensible"" and ""measured"". They are both known by their teams to be extremely hard working and diligent.  
f-perpetuating Tory circus has gone, the ring master retired after the crowd didn't clamour for more. And as one government insider notes, both main party leaders ""are keen to establish themselves for their competence rather than political pyrotechnics"". But that is not the same as ""boring"" for several significant reasons. 
Firstly, we are not living in a time when things are ticking over nicely and government can just trundle along. The choices the new prime minister has to make about the economy are huge. 
Watch: Rishi Sunak's first PMQs in the top job... in 64 seconds
And it can't have escaped your notice - with Jeremy Hunt's sober tones, or countless briefings to journalists about the scary size of the black hole in the public finances - that cuts are coming, even if they end up being less grim than the scariest warnings suggest. 
We'll only know the likely result of those decisions when the chancellor gets to the despatch box on 17 November. We can be sure that it won't be pretty. But the decisions for Mr Sunak go way beyond the choices he has to make about the economy, and they are certainly not ""boring"". 
With millions on waiting lists, social care creaking, the risk of blackouts this winter and climate change, choices have to be made fast on a vast range of issues, and those decisions will have massive consequences for us all. 
And while Mr Sunak's approach on the economy is widely known, his broader instincts are less well understood.  
job is huge, according to another government source, who says: ""We have to get five years' worth of work done in about two."" 
But will it be dull? They add: ""It will be calmer and more stable, but to say Sunak is boring is wrong. He actually has quite an innovative way of looking at things so will shake things up, but in a well thought through way.""  
's an optimistic way of looking at it. One Whitehall source describes him differently, as ""the least experienced prime minister we have had in recent history"". Additionally, as chancellor it was possible for him - as others before him - to stay out of sight for long periods of time.  
Successive new prime ministers and their teams have started out with the intention of being less visible, popping up less, determined to concentrate on the job and their priorities rather than get caught up in frippery or spend time on events that don't match their agenda. 
want to avoid the surreal spectacle of Tony Blair once giving a view on the fortunes of fictional Coronation Street character, Deirdre Rachid. If you are lucky enough not to remember this, it really did happen, as this BBC story from the time shows.  
But successive teams who have entered No 10 with that intention find out that in the real world, they can dictate and control far less than they hope. Life comes at them fast, 24 hours a day, from 360 degrees.  
Mr Sunak has discovered already this week with his first visit, to a hospital. 
re were planned images of him chatting to patients, showing empathy and giving a brief clip to broadcasters on the issues of the day - but it was memorable not because of that, but because a patient took him to task, wagging her finger at him for not paying nurses enough. That encounter was not boring.  
Rishi Sunak says it is right he ""focuses on the... pressing domestic challenges"" the UK faces in its economy rather than got to COP27.
And whether it's on health, the environment, welfare, foreign affairs or other issues, it is hard to know where the new prime minister's political reflexes will lie.  
A Whitehall source who has worked alongside him says he ""is sensible, but not a centrist"", and he may surprise some even of his own supporters by erring to the right.  
Politics is about principles, and we'd all want our leaders to be deeply serious about how they make decisions, but it is also about instinct.  
urce, who has served successive prime ministers, wonders if his character will be well suited for the crucible of Downing Street.
""Boris came to reasonable decisions, but made them in a crazy way and didn't stick to them, Liz neither made the right decisions nor made them in a sensible way,"" they said. 
""He [Sunak] will make them in a sensible way, and it will make a difference. But given the way he delves into detail, how will he cope with the span of the job? You can't do a spreadsheet on every issue when you are the prime minister.""
And while he might be generally seen as sensible, Mr Sunak has already willingly walked into a political controversy that is far from dull. 
He hired back Suella Braverman as home secretary just days after she had been fired for breaking the rules for ministers. She had used her personal email to send government documents to a colleague, and they also ended up with someone else by mistake.  
Holding his carefully constructed government together prevents a huge challenge for the new leader, and it's simply not clear yet if he has the political ability to do that with long-term success. Could anyone?  
Conservatives concluded, less than a week ago, that after all the drama, Mr Sunak was their best option. The impulse to survive after the trauma of the Truss explosion led them to choose the candidate closest to being seen as a safe pair of hands.  
With a smart team around him, a party exhausted by arguing with itself, and a personal reputation for being extremely capable and hardworking, that could turn out to be true.  
But there is nothing remotely guaranteed about that coming to pass, nor is there any certainty that the Sunak premiership will be a success. And however much Conservatives might hope for dull stability, it certainly will not be boring for the rest of us to find out.  "

politics	Qatar World Cup: Welsh government boycotts Wales-Iran game	"A Welsh government minister who was expected to attend Wales' World Cup match with Iran will stay at home due to recent protests in the country. 
It was the only group match in Qatar Deputy Sport Minister Dawn Bowden was due to go to. 
First Minister Mark Drakeford and Economy Minister Vaughan Gething are still attending other World Cup ties.
Qatar has faced criticism in the build-up to the tournament for multiple human rights concerns. 
ude its laws against same-sex relationships, as well as how it treats women and foreign workers. 
Welsh government said it will still attend matches with the US and England, where they say ministers can ""share our interests and values""
BBC Wales was told the decision was due to the recent events in Iran and was not related to the wider debate about whether the entire visit to Qatar was appropriate.
Ms Bowden could attend future matches if Wales advance beyond the group stage, but it is not confirmed.
match against Iran is taking place at 10:00 GMT on 25 November in Al-Rayyan. 
Iran has been criticised internationally for its response to protests sparked by the death of a young woman arrested by the country's morality police.
Welsh government said: ""Welsh ministers will be attending the Wales games against the USA and England, as these represent the most significant opportunities for us to raise the profile of Wales and make connections where we can share our interests and values.
""Ministers will have a full programme of events and meetings to take advantage of this unique opportunity. 
""Welsh ministers will not be attending the Iran game and will be supporting Wales from home.""
Mr Drakeford is expected to attend the fixture against the US, while Mr Gething is planning to go to the England game.
Some gay Welsh fans have said they will stay away from the tournament, and earlier this week Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey criticised Mark Drakeford's decision to go to the tournament.. 
His comments sparked a robust Twitter response from Plaid Cymru MS and Senedd presiding officer Elin Jones, who said it was ""absolutely"" right for Mr Drakeford to attend.
""Our football team is there, so should he be. None of us wanted Qatar to host,"" she said.
As well as supporting Wales' first World Cup appearance since 1958, the Welsh government wants to use the event to raise the country's profile on the world stage.
Mr Drakeford's stance contradicts that of UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who is boycotting the event.
In September, Mr Gething told the Senedd that he, Mr Drakeford and Ms Bowden would attend a ""range of events"", as well as ""each of Wales' group games against the USA, Iran and England"".
Asked if he had considered a boycott, he said: ""We've considered all options, but we think it's the right thing for ministers to go, to support our team, and to make the very best of the opportunity that it is, both in terms of what it does for Wales on the stage, but also in that positive point about projecting and being proud of our values today.""
On Thursday a senior Welsh Labour MP, Rhondda's Chris Bryant, retweeted a report extremely critical of the treatment of LGBT people in Qatar, said: ""This is why no UK officials should be going to the World Cup.""
He did not name any of the Welsh ministers attending.
One Labour politician told BBC Wales they thought Mr Drakeford should not be attending: ""But I get why he is going for Wales"".
But they criticised the planned attendance of two other ministers as a ""pointless waste of money"".
Another Labour elected politician said while as a football fan they were happy that Mr Drakeford was attending, as someone who cared about human rights they were not.
Some Labour backbench Senedd members defended the trip.
Hefin David, Caerphilly MS, said while the event should have never been held in Qatar ""there are good reasons for Wales' government"" to be at the tournament.
John Griffiths, MS for Newport East, said: ""This is an opportunity that might not come along again for some time.""
Welsh Conservative sport spokesman Tom Giffard said: ""The Labour party can't quite decide whether or not they are going to be attending the Qatar World Cup. The hypocrisy is clear for all to see.""
He added that he hoped Mr Drakeford would still go to Qatar: ""It is right however, that the Welsh team are fully supported in their first World Cup since the 1950s.""
Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: ""Iran's human rights record is atrocious and we welcome this [decision]. 
""However, Qatar's is equal as abysmal and the Welsh government shouldn't be sending any Ministers to Qatar itself."""
politics	The local battles behind Tory housing divisions	"""We don't have enough new, purpose-built homes for people in my situation""
government has agreed to water down housing targets for local councils in the face of a rebellion from nearly 60 of its own MPs. But not everyone is happy - some Tories are worried this could lead to fewer homes being built and make it even harder for people to get on the housing ladder. At a local level, new developments provoke passionate views on both sides. 
""Unless I'm prepared to move 100 miles north of here then it's really unlikely I'll be able to get on the housing ladder,"" says Sheldon Allen. 
21-year-old, who is president of Reading University's Students' Union and a Labour activist, is currently renting a room in the town centre for £625 a month.
With bills to pay on top of that he says ""it's a real struggle to make ends meet"".
Sheldon thinks building more homes would help bring down the cost of renting and buying. 
""Ultimately I don't think we have enough new, purpose-built homes for people in my situation and others like me,"" he says.
But in the nearby borough of Wokingham in Berkshire, some locals are angry about the idea of more homes being built in the area. 
""I'm not against houses per se. We've had a lot of housing development in this area,"" says Paul Stevens. ""We feel we've done our bit.""
Paul started a campaign group against plans to build up to 4,500 new homes on an area of land just south of Reading. 
group argues the area lacks the infrastructure needed for a major housing development and risks causing flooding and traffic problems. 
""We're potentially tearing up valuable farmland and growth space to fill it with concrete,"" says Andy Bailey, another member of the group. ""It's sacrilege - this should simply not be happening.""
Local campaigners on housebuilding plans: ""It's sacrilege - this should simply not be happening""
University of Reading, which is one of the owners of the land, says: ""We believe we've put forward a good plan that would provide homes, community facilities, and jobs in creative, heritage and high-tech sectors.""
However, a spokesman adds: ""We recognise this is a difficult balancing act, and we welcome discussion about what's best for everyone.""
A spokeswoman for Wokingham Borough Council says draft development plans were prepared by the previous Conservative administration and the council is gathering evidence before setting out the next stages, with no decisions made yet.
Paul does not dispute that there needs to be more affordable housing for young people but says the homes being built in the area are too expensive to solve the problem. 
""My son couldn't afford to live around here. He couldn't afford to buy anywhere,"" he says. 
""These houses are not being built for young people, they're being built for old people who are escaping London.""
Wokingham's Conservative MP John Redwood was among nearly 60 Tories backing a plan to ban mandatory housebuilding targets in England. 
rebels say targets are undermining local decision-making and mean homes aren't built in the right places.
Housing Secretary Michael Gove has now offered councils more flexibility over meeting the government-set targets to ""reflect local circumstances"". 
He told MPs the targets should be ""an advisory starting point"" rather than mandatory. 
rebels have welcomed the change in position, with Mr Redwood saying it will give councils and local communities a role in deciding what is ""sustainable and appropriate"". 
But other Tories have argued weakening targets would mean fewer houses are built, which they say would be politically damaging for the party. 
government says it's still committed to the national target, set out in the 2019 Conservative manifesto, to build 300,000 homes a year in England by the mid-2020s. 
However, it's on track to miss that target, with the figure remaining below 250,000 in recent years. 
Clive Jones, the Liberal Democrat leader of Wokingham Borough Council, says he is ""cautiously optimistic"" above the government's agreement with the rebels but ""the devil is always in the detail"". 
He is hopeful the change will mean local people can decide the level of housing they want in their area. 
Under the current government-calculated targets, Wokingham needs to build around 800 new homes a year up to 2036. 
Mr Jones says this is too many. 
""We have provided 40,000 new homes in the last 40 years and most people will say that is too much. Enough is enough,"" he says. 
""A lot of people have moved here in the last 40 years. They moved here because they like to be in a semi-rural area because that is what Wokingham is.
""It's changing and it's changing too fast for lots of people. It's becoming like a suburb of south London… and that is not what people want.""
Conservatives lost control of the council in May after two decades in charge - although they remain the largest party. 
Lib Dems now run the council in coalition with Labour and Independent councillors. 
Mr Jones says overdevelopment was one of the big issues which contributed to May's local election result. 
He is standing as the Lib Dem candidate for Wokingham in the next general election, which is due in two years' time. 
Mr Jones believes if the current level of development in Wokingham continues it will be a close fight between the Lib Dems and Conservatives, who currently hold the seat with a majority of 7,383. 
""It won't just be housing - it will be the cost-of living-crisis, it will be the crisis in social care,"" he says.
""All of those things coming together are going to make it very difficult for the Conservatives to hold on to this part of Berkshire.""
Even if local targets are made more flexible, Mr Jones says it won't affect developments which have already been approved. 
""[The Conservatives] have forced all of this housing on us over the past 10 years. We have got loads of outstanding planning permissions which will then be built out so there isn't going to suddenly be no more building here.""

politics	Tory MPs urge PM to change law to ease migrant crisis	"More than 50 Tory MPs have urged Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to alter ""quirks"" in modern slavery laws to make it easier to send some migrants home.
r, arranged by former Brexit Secretary David Davis, demands those travelling from ""safe countries"", such as Albania, be returned more quickly.
MPs maintain a ""simple"" change in the law could ease the current crisis. 
A Home Office source said Home Secretary Suella Braverman was ""working flat out"" to solve the issue.
urce said Ms Braverman and Mr Sunak were working ""to bring in reforms to help stem the flow of migrants across the Channel"".
More than 40,000 people have crossed in small boats from France so far this year.
In the letter, Tories describe the crossings as a ""Gordian Knot that needs cutting with a simple policy"".
gnatories argue that a provision in current law prevents the government from returning a person who says they are a victim of modern slavery to their original home.
""If they have really been taken against their will, then they could not reasonably object to being returned to their own homes,"" the letter said.
""The quirks in our modern slavery laws that prevent this are clearly in defiance of the aims of that law and should be removed.""
MPs, including former cabinet ministers Dr Liam Fox and Esther McVey, and veteran backbenchers Sir Peter Bottomley and Sir Graham Brady, are among the 50-strong body of Conservative politicians calling for the change.
rgue this ""straightforward and legally workable way of addressing the crisis"" would be a ""very strong deterrent"" to those who might be planning to make the trip across the Channel.
Mr Davis said the number of people from safe countries like Albania claiming asylum in the UK was ""paralysing the whole system"". 
""I want to protect the asylum system for people who really need it,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 
rge majority of migrants claim asylum on arrival in the UK and many are housed in hotels while awaiting the outcome of their applications, which are often subject to delay.
Speaking last week, Ms Braverman admitted the UK government has failed to control its borders, blaming migrants and people smugglers for recent chaos at Kent's Manston processing centre.
usands of migrants were placed in tents at the centre during the autumn months, leading to overcrowding and outbreaks of disease. 
Everyone staying at the temporary site has since been placed in alternative accommodation, according to the Home Office.
Last month, MPs from the Home Affairs Committee heard how the UK was spending about £7m a day on hotels to house asylum seekers.
A government spokeswoman said: ""We have made clear that there is no one single solution to stop the increase in dangerous crossings.
""We have also made clear that we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to deter illegal migration.
""We are expediting the removal of individuals by agreeing tailored bilateral returns agreements with partners like Albania, elevating it to a key priority for our foreign policy."""
politics	Is cost of living causing children to miss school in Wales?	"re are calls for an urgent government investigation into children missing school due to the cost of living crisis.
One in five pupils from poorer backgrounds were persistently absent last year, official figures show.
A Senedd report says there needs to be more understanding of the problems facing families, such as travel, uniform, and school trip costs.
Welsh government said improving attendance is a ""national priority"".
Persistent absence is when a pupil misses more than 20% of classes over the school year.
report, following an inquiry by the Children, Young People and Education Committee, said it had received evidence that school closures during the pandemic led to a ""more accepting attitude to lower school attendance"", and suggested a public campaign is needed to help reverse the trend.
Figures for October this year highlight a difference for pupils eligible for free school meals.
Attendance for those who can get free meals is at 86.9%, while those who do not qualify have a better attendance at 93.1%. 
Children's Commissioner for Wales Rocio Cifuentes told the inquiry attendance figures were also ""significantly lower"" for children in year groups not entitled to free travel and that tackling child poverty should be a ""key driver in reducing absence"".
Jayne Bryant, the committee's Labour chairwoman, said sending children to school was an ""expensive business"".
""Parents have to find money for uniforms, books, technology, stationery, school bags, school trips, after school clubs,"" she said. 
""The lack of free transport is also an issue for many - in a cost of living crisis with rising inflation, this is getting even harder every day.
""Today, we're calling on the Welsh government to get to the bottom of how rising costs are impacting pupil attendance and to start campaigns nationwide and locally reinforcing the importance of school attendance.""
As Covid hit education, ministers discouraged councils from fining parents for not ensuring children go to school.
But in May, amid worries about attendances, councils were asked to go back to pre-pandemic guidance.
Education Minister Jeremy Miles emphasised fines should be a ""last-resort"" and would only be used in the most extreme cases.
Responding to the report, Mr Miles said several steps had been taken to support families and schools, including £4m for family engagement officers to work with families and pupils.
""This year we also provided £24m which was focused on learners in exam years, including dedicated funding for an attendance officer in each local authority to support learners,"" he added."

But the idea has not been formally announced and it is not clear why.
A Plaid spokeswoman said the party would explore how changing taxes could look in practice ""over coming weeks"".
was to be presented as a ""solidarity tax"" to help fund public services during the cost of living crisis.
Plaid Cymru is not in government but supports Welsh Labour ministers through the co-operation agreement.
Welsh government has had some income tax powers since 2019, but has never used them.
Ministers can adjust the basic rate, higher rate and additional rate by 10p in every £1, but do not have powers over the thresholds at which people pay the different rates.
Minutes of a meeting of Plaid Cymru's group in the Senedd held in October said seven MSs voted for raising taxes for those earning more than £50,271 in order to fund public services, with three voting against.
minutes said: ""This can be presented as short-term solidarity tax, for specific purposes.
""Some members felt the need to consider the implications of doing this further, and the potential unfairness of raising the higher and extra tax to the same extent.""
In 2023-24, a 4p increase in the higher rate of income tax would raise an estimated £132m and a 5p increase in the additional rate would raise an extra £25m. 
roposal was supported before Plaid Cymru's annual conference, where party leader Adam Price talked generally about the prospect of a ""solidarity tax"" and argued Wales' income tax powers should be ""used progressively to shield the vulnerable and protect our public services"".
But in an interview with the BBC Politics Wales programme on the weekend of Plaid Cymru's conference, he declined to say by how much Plaid would raise income taxes.
He said it would only be possible to ""set out that detail"" following the UK government's Autumn Statement, which was delivered on 17 November.
On 18 October, Mr Price raised the idea of a ""solidarity tax"" in the Senedd and called on First Minister Mark Drakeford to consider raising the top two rates of income tax to ""help us relieve some of the pressure on local services"".
Mr Drakeford said was ""no chance"" the tax rises would cover the costs outlined, describing the idea as ""pie in the sky"". 
A party spokeswoman said: ""Plaid Cymru remain focused on what matters - supporting the most vulnerable in our communities through one of the hardest winters we have faced.
""We look forward to exploring how this could look in practice over the coming weeks by scrutinising the Welsh government budget and engaging with external expert organisations including the Wales Governance Centre.""
Welsh government's draft budget for 2023-24 is due to be published on 13 December."
politics	More Holyrood taxes come at a cost	"re are benefits from putting up taxes, but none of them cost-free. On the upside, John Swinney is raising £129m next year, mainly from higher earners. 
Also on the upside, the Scottish Parliament is moving beyond the experimental phase of fiddling with its new tax powers. Budget day used to be all about how to spend money. This year's budget is at least as much about how to secure the tax revenue necessary.
makes for a more balanced and mature politics than we used to see.
Finding another £129m is not that much in a budget of £45bn, and a long way behind the £918m set to be raised from the effects of inflation. But the way it is funded adds to a developing trend of divergence from the UK's income tax regime.
Scottish Fiscal Commission tells us that the tax take next year is set to be £1bn more than it would have been without devolution of income tax. That is on course to rise above £1.5bn within five years.
A lot of the increase comes from freezing thresholds for different rates of tax. While earners seek pay increases to meet at least some of their additional costs due to inflation, the tax on that delivers more money into the Scottish government kitty. And as more people move into the higher tax bands, a lot more revenue is raised. That is known as fiscal drag or a stealth tax.
ke a look at individual earner level: for those earning above £43,662, each additional pound earned has 42p deducted in Scotland. In the rest of the UK, that deduction is 20p, and so it continues up to £50,270 where the marginal tax rate rises to 40p. 
Also, over that tranche of earnings, National Insurance Contributions, which are linked to rest-of-the-UK thresholds, continue to be deducted at 12p in the pound, before falling to 2p. So the combined deduction from each pound earned at that level in Scotland is 54p, and 32p elsewhere.
So if your earnings are at that higher rate threshold just below £44,000, you are £158 worse off in tax take in Scotland compared with the rest of the UK. If your pay goes up to £50,000, that gap with Westminster will have gone up to £1,558.  For a GP on £100,000 a year, the Scottish income tax bill tops £30,000, and is £2,606 more than it would be for the same earnings in England or Wales.
How many are caught in that wider net of higher tax? The SFC estimates a rise from 11.6% of taxpayers in 2016 to 18.4% next year - nearly one in five. That is no longer an earnings elite.
Looked at another way, by only slightly increasing the threshold for higher rate tax in Scotland since 2016, there has been a 23% growth in the numbers paying it, while raising the threshold in the rest of the UK has led to a drop of 10%.
It goes on to say that the newly announced change in policy would raise an extra £128m, but only if no-one changed their tax arrangements to avoid it - for instance, by taking income as dividends, which are taxed by the UK Treasury. Once ""behavioural effects"" kick in, then SFC estimates revenue falls from £128m to £92m.
re's a more pronounced effect for those earning above £125,000. They face a move from 41p in each extra pound to 47p. The SFC says the change of threshold should bring in £33m if no-one's tax affairs were changed. But once they are, that revenue falls to only £8m.
Raising the tax paid by these highest earners would raise £33m next year, but it's forecast to bring in only £3m.
At the basic level of tax, the effect of fiscal drag is much lower. As people move past its £14,332 lower threshold, the amount of tax paid is expected to rise £20m.  There will be a smaller behavioural change, some of it from people working fewer hours, and the forecast is down only £1m to £19m.
Divergence should come as no surprise.  However the income tax powers were used after being devolved, the point was to use them differently, or perhaps to make a positive choice to leave them unchanged.
In the five years since income tax was devolved, Scottish government ministers began by re-shaping income tax into five strands instead of three, one of which means that the lower paid people are £20 better off in Scotland than they would be in the rest of the UK. That helps make a political point, but makes little difference to public finances.
majority remain no worse off than they would be south of the border on the same pay, but the changes were calibrated to ensure that above-average full time earnings in Scotland come with higher tax bills. In 2023-24, the point at which earners in Scotland start to pay more tax than the person earning the same salary elsewhere is £27,850. 
rogressive, in that the higher burden falls on those who are best equipped to pay. And it helps pay for more generous public services.  
At least in the free provision of student tuition, dental and eye checks, and more generous long-term care packages, there are obvious pay-backs from paying higher tax. 
An uplift in the quality of service is more debatable, as Scotland has long had more inputs per head into schools and the health service.
What is changing fastest in the Scottish budget is the amount going into social security benefits. These are being gradually devolved. Cold weather payments are the latest to move to Holyrood, meaning a £50 flat fee per winter, rather than qualifying through temperature drops over a sustained period.
xpected to cost more than twice as much as it did before. With the intention of prioritising dignity and fairness in allocating welfare payments, and with entirely new benefits being created, such as the Scottish Child Payment, it is a more generous system. 
reasury provides Holyrood with the funds that would have been allocated to Scots if none of this budget were devolved.
SFC reckons that the Scottish government is having to raid other budgets this year for £400m to have a more generous system, rising to £800m next year, and to £1.4bn within five years.
It is, emphasises John Swinney, about choices. Some choices were forced on him: to delay delivery of government projects, though he did little to spell out which ones: a choice not to set a pay policy for next financial year, when it could inflame the unresolved disputes over pay in the current year.
made on tax come with downsides or at least risks.
One is that raising tax in a recession sucks money out of consumer spending and hurts business revenue and economic growth.
A counter-argument to that is that the same pounds put into the pay of a public sector worker or someone on benefits may be more likely to be spent in the economy. If it is a direct transfer, it can be efficient. Lots of other government spending may be less so.
r risk is that these 'behavioural effects' become more significant. We don't know the point at which people decide that Scotland's taxes are too high and they choose to leave, because every such decision is different, and often influenced by other factors.
Even at a high salary of £100,000, the gap between tax paid in Scotland and the bill in England is unlikely, on its own, to make it worthwhile for someone to sell their home and move out of Scotland.
But there is a perception issue for a country that aspires to attract people in, to fill vacancies in its health service, to work in senior positions at its universities, to start up businesses, or to build up tech companies with high-earning employees.
't have to make a calculation of how much higher tax might be. A perception of a country that levies higher tax, and is on a course of continuing to diverge in that direction, while not having much growth, may be a less attractive one for an internationally mobile high-value worker. 
Or it may have the makings of a 'social contract' - one of John Swinney's favourite phrases on budget day - which potential immigrants find attractive.
Either way, both the UK and Scotland seem to be on a journey towards resolving the tensions of wanting Scandinavian level services with American-level tax. 
Conservatives at Westminster are offering a big state for now, though some hanker for a much smaller one.
Scotland is moving faster towards the Scandi choice. But it will require a much more efficiently productive economy, breaking out of chronic low growth that will deliver on that vision. 
SFC report on the state of the economy was grim: unemployment forecast to rise to 4.7%, though from a low base, now at 3.3%; house prices falling by more than 5% and not fully recovering over five years; a recession through next year, which doesn't look as bad as the Bank of England forecast. 
And while it may be shallow, recovery is forecast to be weak - recovering to pre-recession output at the start of 2025, and not getting back to pre-Covid levels of late 2019 until the third quarter of 2025.
By 2026, when growth might reach 2%, the SFC indicates that we may be facing a new challenge of deflating prices.
After last decade's exceptionally weak recovery from the financial crash, this decade looks grim as well, in growth of the economy, and in an unprecedented fall in disposable household income. 
Without faster growth, meeting high expectations of public services will require higher and higher levels of tax."

politics	Farming: Delay to post-EU subsidy scheme Elms not acceptable say farmers	"m Bradshaw said ""uncertainty is crippling businesses""
Farmers have called on the government to clarify what post-EU support they will receive to improve the environment, six years after the Brexit vote.
Cambridgeshire famer Martin Lines said he felt ""let down"" by government delay.
After the UK left the EU, instead of European subsidies a replacement scheme was proposed for farmers, but this has been put back.
government said it was right to review the scheme.
On Thursday, new Environment Secretary and Suffolk Coastal MP Therese Coffey confirmed that the review of the Environmental Land Management Scheme (Elms) was complete and further clarity on the scheme would be announced early in the new year.
Elms payments, which cover England, will replace the EU scheme for agriculture where subsidies were mostly on the basis of the amount of land farmed.
Alongside payments for sustainable farming practices such as managing soils, Elms was designed to pay for ""local nature recovery"" habitat creation on farms and ""landscape recovery"" projects to restore nature at a large scale, including rewilding schemes.
In her speech at the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) conference, Ms Coffey said: ""I am committed to giving you the clarity, certainty and support that I know you need, so early in the new year - I can't make the announcements today - we will be saying more about what we'll be offering to pay you to do in the next phase of all the schemes.""
Martin Lines, who farms about 900 acres (364 hectares) near St Neots in Cambridgeshire, said: ""Moving to a scheme that rewards positive action I've been really supportive of and quite vocally supportive of.
""But I feel quite let down by the government for the lack of information and clarity to help the whole farm industry transition to something better.""
Mr Lines, who is part of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, added: ""They [the government] should get a move on and give us some clarity, give us some real certainty and ambition within the schemes to get to where we all need to get to in the next 10 years.""
Essex farmer Tom Bradshaw, who is also deputy president of the National Farmers' Union, said: ""The latest delay is simply not acceptable. We've had six years to get to this point and we're still kicking the can down the road.
""Members' payments have been reduced and we were always told they would not be reduced until there was another scheme in place.""
Farming minister Mark Spencer told BBC Politics East: ""I think it is quite reasonable to make sure that the schemes we are going to roll out help us as a nation deliver on our carbon commitments and make sure we are improving the environment, improving our biodiversity.
""I think it is reasonable to say when a new secretary of state comes in, she has to have a window of opportunity just to review and make sure that the schemes are going to deliver these outcomes, as we want this to work.""

politics	NI Protocol: Paramilitaries probably involved in protests, says PSNI	"Loyalist paramilitaries probably played a role in organising protest rallies against the Northern Ireland Protocol this year, a police commander has said.
Assistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan said the individuals were part of locally-formed ""coalitions"".
He was responding to questions from South Belfast MP Claire Hanna during a Westminster committee hearing.
Northern Ireland Affairs Committee is taking evidence about the effects paramilitaries are having on society.
Ms Hanna of the SDLP asked him: ""Obviously organising a rally is not a crime but are you aware of any individuals linked to paramilitary organisations who were involved in organising events billed as peaceful protests?""
Mr McEwan responded: ""They were generally organised by what were formed as coalitions.
""There may be members of those coalitions who have links to paramilitary groups, absolutely.
""But that is not to say that the coalitions themselves are controlled by paramilitary groups or otherwise.""
Dozens of peaceful protests were held to express unionist and loyalist opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol, particularly in the run-up to last May's Stormont assembly election.
None have taken place since the summer.
rotocol is the post-Brexit trading arrangement for Northern Ireland, which was agreed between the UK and the EU.
Special arrangements had to be put in place for Northern Ireland after Brexit because it had an EU land border with the Republic of Ireland.
rotocol allows goods to be transported across that border without the need for checks at that point.
Instead the goods are inspected whenever they arrive in Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK.
But unionist political parties argue that the protocol has undermined Northern Ireland's place within the UK by effectively creating a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Unionist politicians such as Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister frequently addressed the protest rallies against the protocol.
Mr McEwan also told the committee that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) does not negotiate with paramilitary figures who act as ""gatekeepers"" in some communities.
Alliance Party MP Stephen Farry said: ""I once remember a new (police) commander coming in to an area and the first photograph which appeared in the local paper was him shaking the hand of the person who was widely known to be a leading paramilitary.
""That type of thing sends out a signal that those are the type of people the police are talking to.
""To be fair this is an issue across the public sector,"" said the North Down politician.
Mr McEwan replied: ""I can't speak to the individual incident.
""Where people who have had former paramilitary connections are involved in constitutionally-formed groups, we do engage with them.
""They are often supported through various levels of government.""
He went on to stress that the police take ""robust"" action against paramilitaries across the spectrum.
""We are fearless in how we go about pursuing them.
""The complexities of a post-conflict society in no way waiver us from our relentless pursuit of criminality."""
politics	Liberal Democrats eye blue wall seats in wake of Tory turmoil	"It can be hard for the Liberal Democrats to make themselves heard at the best of times, but recently the party has been particularly unlucky. 
For two years running the Lib Dems have been unable to gather in person for their annual conference, while other parties' events went ahead - robbing them of a guaranteed moment in the media spotlight. 
ftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 and the death of the Queen this year left them with little choice but to cancel the biggest event in their calendar. 
weekend, party leader Sir Ed Davey is touring Lib Dem target seats and will make a speech in London in an attempt to renew his offer to voters. 
But languishing a distant third in opinion polls and with only 14 MPs, where does the party sit after months of political turmoil at Westminster?
Party insiders point to a run of by-election wins and bold policy pitches as proof the Lib Dems are able to punch above their political weight. 
A surprise victory in the Conservative seat of Chesham and Amersham in June 2021 was followed by wins in other Tory strongholds - North Shropshire later that year and Tiverton and Honiton in June. 
Liberal Democrats hope to replicate this across the so-called 'blue wall' of Conservative-held seats with more affluent and higher educated populations that voted largely to remain in the EU. 
f the list is Wimbledon, where the party lost by just 628 votes in 2019. The Lib Dems report plenty of anti-Conservative sentiment on the doorstep in the leafy south London enclave which returned a Labour MP in 1997 but has been held by the Tories since 2005.
One campaigner was told by a life-long Conservative voter they regretted supporting the party in 2019 and were ""ready for change"", summing up similar sentiment from others.
But conscious of becoming pigeon-holed as a political refuge for liberal Conservative voters fed up with the direction under Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and now Rishi Sunak, the Lib Dems are keen to stress their electoral ambitions extend beyond the south of England. 
In Greater Manchester, for example, the party is looking to build on second place finishes in 2019 in Cheadle and Hazel Grove, where it recently took control of Stockport Borough Council in this year's local elections. 
Sir Ed Davey celebrates his party's win in the Chesham and Amersham while breaking down a model blue wall
Common among the party's target seats is a high proportion of home ownership, leaving voters in these areas exposed to the impact of recent interest rate rises. 
Recent polling conducted on the party's behalf suggested a majority of Conservative voters blamed the government for rising mortgages, compounding the Lib Dems' message that the blue wall is being ""hit hardest"" by the knock-on effects of an increase in interest rates. 
In the aftermath of the tax-cutting mini-budget delivered by Kwasi Kwarteng in September, a  poll found two thirds (68%) of people who had voted Conservatives in 2019 said the government would be to blame if mortgage bills subsequently increased. 
f 2,240 adults aged 18+ was conducted by Savanta ComRes between 30 September and 2 October.
Sir Ed Davey is expected to make a call for homeowners struggling to pay their mortgage to be better protected in a speech to party activists in London on Sunday. 
Lib Dems hope the move will influence the political debate around an issue facing millions of voters in a similar way to the party's calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and an energy price freeze this winter. 
Similarly, the party hopes to capitalise on a sense of frustration among voters that key public services are ""broken"", as one senior party figure put it, with their call for guaranteed GP appointments within a week in England. 
Eye-catching policies may gain the Lib Dems some attention and allow them to punch above their political weight, but their prospects at the next election may have as much if not more to do with the fortunes of their opponents as it does their own offering. 
Senior Lib Dems considered the Conservatives to be vulnerable on the economy while Boris Johnson was prime minister and sought to ""hammer home"" the impact of the rising cost of living. 
urmoil that marked Liz Truss's time in No 10 may have fuelled their attacks on government incompetence, but will the same tactics work against the new man in charge?
Lib Dems claim not to be fazed by Rishi Sunak as prime minister, citing what they see as his slowness to act as chancellor on the cost of living crisis and controversy around Suella Braverman's re-appointment as home secretary as potential weak points. 
Labour's lead in opinion polls has widened as popularity plummeted for the Conservatives, but the Lib Dems' standing has remained largely stagnant. 
Some in the party argue that anti-Conservative sentiment can only be a good thing for the Lib Dems and increase the party's chances of unseating Tory MPs at the next election. 
Furthermore, insiders claim Labour's apparent popularity among voters helps the party too, removing the 2019 ""fear factor"" of a Jeremy Corbyn government which may have prevented some Conservative voters switching to the Lib Dems in blue wall seats. 
Sir John Curtice, president of the British Polling Council, said the Liberal Democrats would ""probably pick up Labour voters in places where they're second"".
But he added that the economy was ""never ever their strong point"" and voters may struggle to identify the party's position on major issues. 
""I'm just not sure enough people know what the hell they stand for,"" Sir John said. 
may not worry the Lib Dems as much as it might. 
At the 2019 general election the then party leader Jo Swinson touted herself as the UK's next prime minister and talked of winning ""hundreds of seats"". 
Her successor is unlikely to make a similar pitch, instead seeking to make the most of hostility towards the Conservatives and argue that electing Liberal Democrat MPs in seats where Labour is unlikely to win is the only way to remove them from government. "
politics	Deaths in Scottish prisons at record high	"Stuart Allan says the impact of the death of daughter Katie in prison has been massive
A record number of people have died in Scottish prisons in the past three years.
A report, by academics at Glasgow University, shows there have been 121 deaths since the start of 2020, with suicide and drugs deaths on the rise.
rate of suicide and drugs deaths in Scottish jails is significantly higher than in England, the report said. 
Scottish Prison Service said it worked to give people the best possible care and wellbeing. 
w report, seen by the BBC, studied data going back to 1995.
It said the 121 people who died in prison in Scotland between the start of 2020 and September this year compared with 98 in the previous three full years.
Covid played a role in the record-breaking number of prison deaths, with 15 prisoners dying from the virus, but deaths from other medical conditions have held fairly steady while drugs fatalities and people taking their own lives have been on the rise.
re have been 29 deaths by suicide and 25 from drugs since the start of 2020, with a further eight whose cause is undetermined, which could add to the drugs toll.
mics said deaths from suicide and drugs were typically ""from distress and loss of hope"", which are of particular concern when assessing prison regimes and conditions
report said a person who was imprisoned in 2022 in Scotland would be twice as likely to die in jail as someone in 2008.
Prof Sarah Armstrong, one of the lead authors of the report, said: ""We don't have a death penalty anymore in this country and yet for many people - more than 100 - going to prison is a death sentence. 
""We are talking about people who are entirely dependent on the state to live. 
""People in prison won't get food, won't get healthcare or shelter unless the state does its job. 
""And when you have such a high rate of death in prison - and a higher suicide rate and drug death rate than in English prisons - real questions are raised about the quality of that care.""
rison service introduced its suicide prevention strategy called Talk To Me six years ago.
mics found that there had been a 42% increase in suicides since the strategy was introduced compared with the six previous years.
Katie Allan was a third year student at Glasgow University when she was jailed for a hit and run incident. She was just 21 when she took her own life in Polmont in 2018. 
Her mother Linda Allan, who is an academic and co-author of the report, said: ""People in prison are being failed by the state and losing their lives in the care of the state. And very often - in our opinion - that is avoidable."" 
Katie's father Stuart said there had been more than 50 suicides in Scottish jails since his daughter died. 
""The impact on us has been massive,"" he said. 
""You don't go a day or a moment in the day without thinking about Katie."" 
Mr Allan said he lived his life battling to get a justification for why Katie died and to make sure it did not happen to other people who found themselves in the prison service.
Fatal Accident Inquiries (FAIs) are meant to ensure an effective investigation into deaths and accountability but the report said they were failing to do that. 
It found that, on average, FAIs into prison deaths took more than two years to complete and almost never made any recommendations or offered points of learning for the prison service. 
One inquiry published earlier this year took more than four years and made no findings beyond time, place and cause of death. 
report highlighted cases where prisoners died arguably preventable deaths, including one man who died from psoriasis after waiting months for medical treatment. 
It also highlighted inmates who took their own lives after not being placed on suicide watch despite a history of self-harm. 
report said: ""One year has passed since we reported that deaths have been rising in Scottish prisons, and that FAIs to investigate these take a significant amount of time only to determine no changes are needed. 
""Since then, deaths have continued to rise, accelerating during the pandemic for reasons beyond Covid, and FAIs are continuing to take years with the same low rate of determining nothing could be done, or can be done.""
Scottish government-commissioned Independent Review of the Response to Deaths in Custody, published 12 months ago, emphasised ""the human rights obligation of the state to carry out an effective investigation into death and ensure accountability where state responsibility arises"".
Scottish government accepted the recommendation and set up a deaths in custody action group - but since then the rate of deaths has increased. 
A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said: ""We recognise the profound emotional distress experienced by families when a loved one dies in custody.""
He said the prison service wanted people to have the best possible health and wellbeing and was working closely with the NHS and charities on suicide prevention.
Earlier this year, the prison service said the most common way to smuggle psychoactive substances into jails was by spraying them on to pieces of paper posted to prisoners.
SPS spokesman said preventative measures such as photocopying mail had led to a significant fall in illicit substance misuse.
He also said that there are increasing numbers of older people in prison, with the same health and care challenges as the wider community.
A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The safe treatment and mental health of all those in custody is a key priority for Scotland's prisons, which care for people with higher levels of risk and vulnerability than the general population as a whole.
""The Crown Office has significantly reformed its processes to reduce the time taken to investigate deaths and to bring FAIs to court more quickly. It is for the presiding sheriff, who has heard all the evidence, to determine what recommendations, if any, should be made."""
politics	Tory MP Andrew Bridgen facing suspension from Commons	"Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen is facing a Commons suspension after breaching lobbying rules ""on multiple occasions and in multiple ways"".
ross-party Standards Committee found he had displayed a ""very cavalier"" attitude to the rules. 
It called for him to be suspended for a total of five sitting days for offences including an ""unacceptable attack upon the integrity"" of Standards Commissioner Kathryn Stone.  
whole House will vote on sanctions. 
In a statement, the North West Leicestershire MP said he was ""extremely disappointed"", but accepted the committee's findings and would ""comply with them as required to do so"", 
mmittee said Mr Bridgen had called the integrity of Ms Stone into question on the basis of ""wholly unsubstantiated and false allegations, and attempted to improperly influence the House's standards processes"".  
It recommended a suspension of three days for this - in addition to two days for for three breaches of the MPs' code of conduct, including failing to declare a relevant interest in emails to ministers.
report found Mr Bridgen had ""demonstrated a very cavalier attitude to the House's rules on registration and declaration of interests, including repeatedly saying that he did not check his own entry in the register"". 
mmittee said Mr Bridgen should have told ministers and officials he received a donation and a funded visit to Ghana from the Cheshire-based firm Mere Plantations, and had a £12,000 contract to be an adviser.  
He was found to have committed a ""significant litany of errors"" by failing to do so in eight emails to ministers, and in five meetings with ministers or public officials, as he discussed Mere's tax treatment and trading of carbon credits. 
MP had questioned whether his reputation as an outspoken critic of then-prime minister Boris Johnson could have influenced Ms Stone's findings.
He wrote to her saying: ""I was distressed to hear on a number of occasions an unsubstantiated rumour that your contract as Parliamentary Standards Commissioner is due to end in the coming months and that there are advanced plans to offer you a peerage, potentially as soon as the Prime Minister's resignation honours list.
""There is also some suggestion amongst colleagues that those plans are dependent upon arriving at the 'right' outcomes when conducting parliamentary standards investigations.
""Clearly my own travails with Number 10 and the former PM have been well documented and obviously a small part of me is naturally concerned to hear such rumours.
""More importantly however you are rightfully renowned for your integrity and decency and no doubt such rumours are only designed to harm your reputation.""
mmittee said Mr Bridgen's email ""appears to be an attempt to place wholly inappropriate pressure on the commissioner"" which is ""completely unacceptable behaviour"".
Commons will vote on whether to approve the recommended five days' suspension. 
Mr Bridgen must also apologise to the House and the commissioner. But he will not face a recall petition from his constituents - that could have triggered a by-election - because the period of suspension falls short of the 10 sitting days required. 
His trip in August 2019 to a plantation funded by Mere, which grows mainly teak in the Ashanti region of Ghana while focusing on the reforestation of degraded land, was valued at £3,251.51.
Mr Bridgen argued during the investigation that the lobbying rules did not apply because the trip was of ""negative financial benefit"" to him.
He said he was left ""personally out of pocket"" because he paid for his own yellow fever vaccination and bought local currency which he could not convert to pounds once back in the UK.
""This local currency I gave away to a Ghanaian doorkeeper in Parliament as I would not be visiting again,"" he told the committee.
Mere also donated £5,000 to Mr Bridgen's local Conservative association in October 2019.
His correspondence with ministers included emails to Kwasi Kwarteng when he was business secretary in February 2021 and then-financial secretary to the Treasury Jesse Norman in August 2021. 
Mr Bridgen argued he did not need to declare interests when ""acting as a constituency MP"", but the committee ruled that this exemption ""cannot be considered as a blank cheque"" and that his activities extended beyond the initial constituency focus.
Ms Stone - who is independent - found that the MP ""habitually failed to declare his interests with Mere Plantations"".  
Labour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the case was ""just another example of the lack of ethics and integrity at the heart of the Conservative Party"". "

politics	Hythe Tory councillor resigns over far-right links	"A Tory councillor has quit after fresh evidence emerged over his links to a far-right organisation.
Andy Weatherhead had already been suspended by his local party in Kent after it emerged he used to be a member of the New British Union (NBU).
Hythe West councillor now says he is stepping down as a member on Kent County Council (KCC).
It comes as the BBC uncovered an interview in 2014 which apparently shows the extent of his NBU links.
Mr Weatherhead confirmed he gave the interview, but denied he was NBU policy officer, the term used by the interviewer to introduce him.
He gave the interview to an online radio station called the American Nationalist Network under the pseudonym Andrew Blackhouse.
In the recording, he is heard saying: ""I've always been an admirer of fascism. I've always been an admirer of Benito Mussolini and Sir Oswald Mosley, and last year I was trawling through the internet as one does and came across the New British Union and I thought 'hello, this sounds like right up my street', so I contacted them.""
He also refers to his work for the NBU as ""fleshing out policies"".
Mr Weatherhead apologised in a statement given to the BBC and said: ""It was not my intent to cause harm or offend. It is in the past. I completely and utterly reject anything to do with fascism.""
He said he had not heard from or seen NBU leader Gary Raikes since 2014.
He also claimed that when he had talked about ""fleshing out policies"" in the interview, this meant ""adding punctuation"".
Mr Weatherhead said the policies themselves had been written by the British Union in the 1930s.
Last week, after he was suspended by Folkestone and Hythe Conservatives, he said the NBU had not been a registered political party, had no defined membership and his links with the group were ""in the spirit of education and curiosity"".
He said after 2014 he had re-entered mainstream politics and turned his back on fringe politics ""having seen it for what it truly was"".
r of KCC, Roger Gough, said he welcomed Andy Weatherhead's resignation as a councillor.
He said: ""The views and associations reported have no place in the Kent County Council Conservative group.""

He has been suspended as a Conservative MP since announcing he was off to Australia. One Tory colleague described him as an ""absolute prat"" and he has faced calls from opposition politicians to give up his MP's salary, £84,144 a year.
He was appointed health secretary in 2018, before overseeing pandemic restrictions including lockdowns and social distancing.
footage, which showed him breaking his own social distancing rules with his political aide and university friend Gina Coladangelo, was leaked to the Sun. 
Dominic Cummings, who was Boris Johnson's closest advisor, claimed Mr Hancock had lied about Covid testing hospital patients before they were released into care homes. This was firmly denied by Mr Hancock. Mr Cummings also published expletive-laden messages about a different issue, purportedly from Boris Johnson, in which the PM calls the health secretary ""hopeless"".
Born and raised in Cheshire, he studied philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University and then economics at Cambridge. Before becoming MP for West Suffolk he worked for his family's computer software business and as an economist for the Bank of England. He has three children.
He's said he hopes to use his time in the jungle to raise awareness about the learning difficulty that affects reading and writing. 
In 2012, he won a charity horse race after training for three months, losing two stone in the process. Nicknamed ""Action Matt"" by the press, photos of him running, swimming and jumping over small fences often appear in the newspapers."

politics	Brexit: Talks on Northern Ireland Protocol 'making slow progress'	"ks between Brussels and London about the Northern Ireland Protocol are said to be making slow progress.
ks continue but no proper ""big meetings"" have taken place this week, with many officials on leave.
EU sources say they were still waiting for the new government to clearly set out its position.
rotocol keeps Northern Ireland aligned with some EU trade rules to ensure goods can move freely across the Irish land border after Brexit.
UK wants a fundamental rewrite of the treaty while the EU believes sufficient ""flexibilities"" can be found within the existing text.
Unionist parties argue that it has undermined Northern Ireland's place within the UK by effectively creating a trade border with Great Britain.
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has refused to return to the governing executive at Stormont until the protocol is scrapped or changed - and power-sharing has stalled in Northern Ireland as a result.
But on Friday Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said there would not be a Stormont assembly election before Christmas.
It is understood that the Irish government pushed for the Stormont election to be delayed.
May's election resulted in Sinn Féin - a nationalist party that supports the protocol - winning the most seats at Stormont for the first time.
Diplomats have said it is not yet exactly clear to them what direction Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wants to take on the protocol - as well as on wider international issues.
""It's understandable but regrettable that he seems to be tied up in domestic politics,"" said one diplomat.
warmer mood music - that preceded Mr Sunak's arrival in Downing Street - is still being welcomed in Brussels but many are asking: ""What's the substance?""
re are hopes some progress can be made in the protocol talks over the coming weeks - with customs and trade-data sharing frequently cited as areas of possible progress.
However, the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill - which is making its way through Parliament - is still regarded in Brussels as a ""poisonous"" cloud over negotiations.
gislation could hand UK ministers powers to unilaterally start changing parts of the mutually agreed treaty.

UK previously softened demands to remove the European Court of Justice from its oversight role.
But political pressure on that issue, from some on the Conservative benches, is likely to continue.
And while Mr Sunak is yet to outline his thoughts on the protocol in detail, he inherited a position whereby the UK wanted the actual text of the treaty to be renegotiated.
Government insiders have suggested that the approach remains broadly the same, signalled by a decision to keep Chris Heaton-Harris as Northern Ireland secretary and James Cleverly at the Foreign Office.

politics	Gwent Police: Welsh ministers might back wider investigation	"A minister says the Welsh government will consider a call for a national inquiry into England and Wales police forces, after allegations of misogyny, corruption and racism at Gwent Police. 
Gwent Chief Constable Pam Kelly has said Wiltshire Police will independently investigate Gwent Police.
But ex-Crown Prosecution Service head Nazir Afzal wants a wider probe.
Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""We'll consider the call before coming out with a more considered view"".
Welsh government has no jurisdiction over policing matters, which are the responsibility of the Home Office within the UK government.
Gwent investigation has been compared by Labour MP Ruth Jones to ""police officers marking police officers' homework"". 
Wiltshire Police said it was ""not uncommon for police forces to request other forces to take on independent investigations"".
Gwent Police is not commenting on Ms Jones's criticism.
review emerged on the weekend after the Sunday Times reported on messages between serving and retired officers.
A solicitor acting for the family of a policeman whose phone sparked the probe said on Monday that he had ""never seen anything like"" the messages they found.
Craig Court said messages on the phone of Gwent Police officer Ricky Jones, who died in 2020, revealed affairs, corruption, misogyny and homophobia.
Mr Afzal, until recently a Welsh government advisor, said a national inquiry is needed because problems are ""likely to be everywhere"" across forces in Wales and England.
""The vast majority of police officers are very good at what they do and clearly not bigoted or prejudiced, but there is a sizable minority, unfortunately, who are racist, sexist, homophobic, corrupt, and there's nothing in my mind worse than a bigot with a warrant card,"" he said. 
Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Gething said there had been ""no hesitation"" from Gwent Chief Constable Pam Kelly in expressing ""how appalled"" she had been ""at the allegations"" and ""the investigation is taking place by a separate police force"".
""All of us should be able to have trust and confidence in the police and if it is revealed there are people who wear the uniform who absolutely should not it is, of course, a point of concern,"" he said. 
""I've seen the wider issues in relation to the [Metropolitan Police] and others, I'd want to reflect and consider the call from Nazir Afzal and others for a wider investigation, and to understand how that will practically make a difference.""
Mr Gething said he wanted ""to make sure that we all get the police force that we deserve as citizens, but also that all the many decent men and women who serve in our police forces"" have officers ""alongside them that won't embarrass and shame them in the way that, I'm afraid, far too many have done"". 
""So I think we'll consider the call before coming out with a more considered view on Nazir Afzal's suggestion,"" he added."
politics	Can the UK-France crackdown on Channel smugglers work?	"French patrols often describe their mission as a game of cat-and-mouse, played against the clock, in the dark.
rthern French coastline offers a smorgasbord of hiding places for smugglers. Trees give good protection from surveillance planes, World War Two bunkers are ideal accommodation for passengers, and sand dunes and scrubland hide boats and slow patrols.
Equipment has helped. UK-funded drones, equipped with thermal-imaging cameras, have changed the game for gendarmes here, spotting people even under tree cover.
Specialist buggies built for sand dunes - another contribution from the UK - have helped units get there faster. But the last stretch to where a boat is being prepared for launch often must be covered on foot - through soft sand and thickets of thorny shrubs, sometimes chest-high.  
I've seen officers emerge from the chase with long deep scratches on their bodies - the thorns having torn through both uniform and flesh.
It's not hard to hear a patrol wading through that scrub. By the time gendarmes arrive, there's often just an abandoned boat and some petrol left behind. 
mugglers know what they're doing.
re is, the UK government says, no silver bullet.  But the resources ploughed into this coastline, year after year, are having some effect: 30,000 crossings attempts have been intercepted so far this year.  
And this latest deal contains two key messages about what's working - operationally and politically.
Firstly, there's more investment for equipment and patrols, with the goal of doubling the proportion of crossings that are intercepted.
And secondly, there's a new agreement that France will host British officers in command centres on French soil, to share information and help direct resources.
Sources close to the negotiations also tell me that France has also offered to allow British officers to come out on patrol with French unit as observers.
And Tony Smith, former Border Force director-general, believes it's a step in the right direction.
""We haven't had very much control in the past, about exactly how the French deploy the resources we're paying for,"" he told me. ""This new agreement means that we have now got operational and tactical liaison going on about deployments.""
UK has lobbied for years to have police on the ground here. 
When I asked the French Interior Minister last year about France's refusal of this request, he said it was an issue of sovereignty. Giving me a little smile, he added: ""Sovereignty is something the British understand.""
So this new concession by the French government could be read as a sign of slowly warming relations between Paris and London, after years of tension under Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.
""I'm hearing that liaison with the French is much better now than it was,"" said Tony Smith. ""Now that Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman have reached out the olive branch to the French, that seems to have paid at least some dividends.""
""These observers could help [the UK] understand the difficulties we are in,"" said the Republican MP for Calais, Pierre Henri Dumont. ""We cannot have half our police officers on the French coast. We don't have the human resources. We're talking about human personnel, not just drones and cameras.""
Others here are more cynical. As one official at the Calais town hall privately suggested to me, including British police in the operation here - even as observers - makes it harder for those in the UK to continue pointing the finger of blame at France."

politics	Treasury warns of tax rises to fill financial hole	"Everyone will have to pay more tax to put the UK's public finances on a sustainable footing, the Treasury is warning.
A source said spending cuts alone would not be enough to ensure the government meets its targets on spending and debt.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt held talks with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday, ahead of a budget on 17 November.
A Treasury source said across-the-board tax hikes were ""inevitable,"" adding: ""It is going to be rough"". 
rtment has not put a figure on what it calls the ""fiscal black hole"" facing the UK, the BBC has previously been told it may be at least £50bn.
Mr Hunt is now due to deliver a financial statement on 17 November, after the much-anticipated plan was pushed back by two weeks after Mr Sunak replaced Liz Truss in Downing Street.
Few concrete details of the government's plans have emerged, but reports have suggested ministers could extend a freeze on income tax thresholds, dragging more people into the higher rate.
Daily Telegraph has reported that Mr Hunt is planning to fill the budgetary shortfall through a combination of 50% tax rises and 50% cuts to public spending. 
His predecessor George Osborne, who oversaw a period of austerity after 2010, worked to a broad formula of 80% cuts and 20% tax rises.
While the Treasury said Mr Hunt and Mr Sunak ""agreed on the principle that those with the broadest shoulders should be asked to bear the greatest burden,"" it warned that ""given the enormity of the challenge, it is inevitable that everybody would need to contribute more in tax in the years ahead"". 
government has sought to brace the public for the impending change of direction, after Ms Truss's mini-budget last month pushed up the cost of UK government borrowing.
reasury source said increased public debt to pay for Covid-19 support and help with energy costs meant ""we won't be able to fill the fiscal black hole through spending cuts alone"".
Ministers have not ruled out real-terms cuts to pensions and benefits by raising them below the rate of inflation, a move that could save billions.
Opposition parties have resisted such a move, and are calling on the government to increase windfall taxes on oil and gas companies.
Ms Truss had ruled out additional windfall taxes, saying they would send the ""wrong message"" to international investors.
But the Times has reported Mr Hunt is considering increasing the current windfall tax, and extending the end-date from 2025 to 2028. 
wspaper said officials had also been working on plans for a windfall tax on electricity generating companies - a move also demanded by opposition parties. 
What is commonly called a ""black hole"" in the public finances refers to the amount the government would have to raise taxes by, or cut spending, to meet its medium-term financial targets.
, in the third year of official economic forecasts, government debt should be falling as a share of national income, and day-to-day government spending should be met by tax revenue.
rojections are dependent on estimates about how much the economy will grow.
ze of the shortfall has shrunk slightly since Mr Hunt reversed most of the measures introduced at last month's mini-budget. At the time, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated it could be as much as £62bn.
In a new report, the Resolution Foundation think tank predicted that many of the options facing the government would be ""unpalatable"", as more people could be pushed into the higher 40% rate of tax in a bid to make up the shortfall. 
Mr Sunak is also said to be considering freezing international aid for two years, and cutting investment spending. 
But analysts have already warned that there remains little scope for further cuts to public spending after years of austerity under Conservative governments.

made up of about 20 people, usually MPs but sometimes members of the House of Lords. They are known as ministers, or in some cases, secretaries of state, depending on the job. 
For example, the finance minister - who goes by the title chancellor of the exchequer - decides how much money you will be taxed and where that money will be spent, while the home secretary looks after UK borders and policing. 
jobs are often given to the PM's friends and supporters. It's called a ""reshuffle"" when lots of the ministers are moved around, promoted or fired. Ministers can move between very different departments, so for instance they could move from transport to culture.
So the health secretary doesn't need to have worked as a doctor or nurse, for example. They take advice and decide what the department does. They take into account how much money needs to be spent, whether it's what the government promised they'd do, and how it affects voters.
Each department works with civil servants - people who aren't elected politicians or loyal to any political party. They work to make the government's plans happen.
meets weekly around a long table covered in deep green felt and there's a carved chair for every minister. The PM sits in the middle and where everyone else sits is said to indicate how important they are.

politics	Minister refuses to pause National Care Service plan	"Scottish government has been defending its plans for a new National Care Service.
government says the system will be the biggest shakeup of public services since the creation of the NHS and will end a social care ""postcode lottery"".
But questions have been raised about the cost of setting it up and what it means for local decision-making.
Social Care Minister Kevin Stewart faced calls to pause the scheme at Holyrood's finance committee.
Mr Stewart said there was no reason to do so but acknowledged that there were currently ""various unknowns"" that could have an impact on the financial cost of setting up the new service.
He promised that further details of the finances would be forthcoming, and said there was overwhelming support for the changes from people who rely on social care.
And he told the committee that the process of ""co-designing"" the legislation with other organisations meant certain financial assumptions could not be made right now.
Scottish Conservative finance spokeswoman Liz Smith told Mr Stewart that MSPs did not currently have enough information to properly scrutinise the government's plans.
Ms Smith said the financial memorandum associated with the bill was the weakest she had ever seen in Parliament, and urged Mr Stewart to consider pausing the scheme until he was able to provide more detail.
government committees also spent Tuesday morning scrutinising the National Care Service Bill, which lays out the framework for the new system.
f the National Care Service were sown during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the virus took a terrible toll on many care homes.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a new body could provide a ""lasting and positive legacy"", in the same way as the ""tragedy"" of World War Two led to the creation of the National Health Service.
Post-pandemic, the government commissioned an independent review of adult social care, led by Derek Feeley, a former chief executive of NHS Scotland.
His report considered options which stretched as far as nationalising the private care sector - something ultimately deemed too expensive and time-consuming - before coming down in favour of a new national management body.
MSPs at Holyrood are now scrutinising the National Care Service Bill, which sets up the framework on which the new service will be built.
recreate a free-at-the-point-of-need system like the NHS, but for care.
It would set up a series of regional care boards, which Scottish ministers would ultimately be responsible for.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said this would end a ""postcode lottery"" and create uniform standards for care across the country.
He said this meant everyone would have access to ""consistently high-quality care and support so they can live a full life"".
Mr Feeley also said it could ""drive national improvements"" and help unite agencies and staff behind ""a common purpose"". 
w system would be a huge undertaking, drawing together social work, children's services and justice staff as well as those from care homes and care at home services.
Ministers say the new service will aim to support people in their own homes, or among family, friends or their community wherever possible.
It will also create a charter of rights and responsibilities for social care, with a robust complaints and redress process.
Pretty much everyone I talk to in healthcare, be it GPs, A&E consultants, social workers, or charities, support the idea of a National Care Service - but there are big concerns about how it is being shaped through this new bill. 
Some question a lack of detail saying it doesn't address how services are to be funded or staffed. Others have raised concerns that it takes accountability away from local communities.  
But the bottom line is that health and social care needs people to provide care and deliver services. That is something that we are extremely short of right now. 
We've heard a lot lately about record delays getting people out of hospital and how that leads to long waits in A&E.
roblem requires finding more social care support. It is a hot topic right now - but better integration between hospitals and community health and social care has long been seen as in need of improvement.
People are living longer with more complex conditions. That means a growing demand for carers, occupational therapists or district nurses. 
It can also take time to make a home accessible or fit additional equipment to help with everyday tasks. There can be differences in provision depending on where you live and that is something the National Care Service is supposed to end.  
Councils would essentially no longer be involved in the delivery of social care - and complain that this could undermine local accountability.
't like the idea of a ""power grab"" by central government, and are wary of the potential impact of tens of thousands of staff moving across from them to the new care service.
Local authority umbrella body Cosla said it could pose ""a serious risk to councils' ability to deliver a wide range of services for communities"".
Unite union called the proposals an ""all-out assault on local democracy"", while GMB Scotland said workers ""haven't even been an afterthought"" in the drafting of legislation.
Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservatives said setting up a new service would ""see precious resources diverted away from the front line and into employing hundreds more management and admin staff"".
Beyond these practical concerns, some charities have also raised questions about the care on offer.
Neurological Alliance of Scotland has described the service as  ""a vision without a blueprint"", adding that ""we can't tell if it will even stand up, much less that it will meet the care needs of people in Scotland"".
f the biggest questions - and controversies - over the plans, at least in terms of the debate at Holyrood.
Scottish government initially reckoned it would cost £500m to set up the new system, by the end of the current Holyrood term in 2026.
However, Scottish Parliament researchers have estimated the bill over five years to be somewhere between £664m and £1.2bn.
And Audit Scotland has warned that ""the potential for additional cost is significant"", highlighting issues with pensions, VAT changes, capital investment and health board transition costs.
SNP backbenchers have joined in with criticism, with finance committee convener Kenny Gibson saying the reorganisation was ""like a sledgehammer to crack a nut"" if it did not provide extra funding to address issues in the healthcare sector.
His SNP colleague Michelle Thomson said she had ""no confidence whatsoever"" that the financial memorandum accompanying the legislation represented any level of accuracy or value for money.
ge of the National Care Service Bill is really only the beginning at Holyrood.
It is a ""framework"" bill, meaning it sets out the broad overall plan for the service, before ministers add much more detail in the coming years.
So while the government hopes to pass the bill in the coming year, it will be some time before the final vision is realised.
Consultations are still ongoing about what exactly some of the new structures will look like, with ministers saying they want to ""co-design"" the system with people who have experience of care.
ubstantially completed within the current term of parliament - so by 2026 - but the system  is expected to continue to bed in and evolve for years to come."

His official spokesman said Mr Lewis's claim was not an appropriate comparison and any accommodation would come with ""the right levels of support"". 
A Labour spokesman said it would be a matter for the whips whether Mr Lewis should face disciplinary action. 
Asked if leader Sir Keir Starmer would urge the Norwich South MP not to repeat the remarks, the spokesman said: ""Yes.""
Responding to the asylum housing plans on BBC Two's Politics Live, Mr Lewis said: ""It's a concentration of people.... Look what they're talking about - putting people in camps en masse because of their [the government's] mess.
""Let's just be really clear where we are - that is the technical term for it, a concentration of people in a camp.""
Former Conservative minister Damian Green, who was also appearing on the show, described the comments as ""ridiculous"".
Mr Sunak unveiled plans to tackle the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats and the backlog of asylum cases in the Commons on Tuesday. 
He said the government was spending £5.5m a day on housing asylum seekers in hotels. 
um backlog has ballooned in recent years, with 117,000 outstanding claims, relating to 143,377 people, who are waiting for an initial decision on their application and unable to work. Of these, nearly 100,000 people have been waiting more than six months.
government has pledged to clear the backlog of initial asylum claims made up to 28 June by the end of next year."
politics	China protests: Uncertainty reigns for foreign firms	"For foreign companies that operate in China, the unprecedented protests at the weekend could not have come at a worse time.
It has been almost three years of intermittent lockdowns, disrupted supply chains and rules that have made the country uninviting to international staff. The last year has been particularly painful - as the rest of the world opened up and learned to live alongside the virus. 
""In my 12 years of being in China, I have never seen the levels of social and economic disruption. The extraordinary civil unrest taking place at the moment is all due to zero-Covid fatigue,"" the British Chamber of Commerce's Managing Director Steven Lynch told the BBC.  
""This is the lowest level of sentiment we've ever experienced, certainly for British businesses.""
Protests and political instability are not good for business. But it is the Covid numbers in China that are really rattling investors. 
Recent days have seen about 40,000 new cases - record highs for China - and with authorities determined to stamp out infections according to President Xi Jinping's zero-Covid strategy, that could mean more disruption to manufacturing, services and normal consumer behaviour.
European Chamber of Commerce in China, which represents more than 1,700 members across the country, on Tuesday called for a vaccination campaign to be rolled out to the entire population, and to ease current virus control measures. 
""This should be preceded by a comprehensive, nationwide education campaign about Covid-19, based on the latest scientific evidence, in order to alleviate any public anxiety and to illustrate that being fully vaccinated significantly reduces the risk of contracting serious disease,"" it said in a statement.
Chinese government says it is taking some action. 
At a press conference on Tuesday, State Council health officials said they would speed up a push to vaccinate the elderly and more vulnerable members of society. They also announced a publicity campaign to combat vaccine hesitancy among the elderly and promote vaccines' ability to protect against severe illness and death.
But they insisted any complaints about Covid restrictions stemmed from ""overzealous implementation"" rather than the measures themselves.
WATCH: Five dramatic days in China as protesters take to the streets
When asked if the protests would encourage authorities to reconsider the policy, a spokeswoman for the National Health Commission, said policy would be ""fine-tuned"" to control the impact on society and the economy.
Many companies still want to keep business in the vast market going - even as strict Covid measures have made international operations harder.
""Many companies are doing very well despite the headwinds. Look at Starbucks, Nike, and Mercedes,"" Frank Lavin, former US under secretary of commerce for international trade said.
""They already have resiliency plans in place. Those who might be more vulnerable are the smaller and medium size companies doing business in China that don't have a resiliency plan. You can't expect the business plan that worked at home will work abroad,"" Mr Lavin added.
China's growth into the world's second-largest economy relied heavily on foreign investment and those firms are now keen to reap the reward. 
untry is a growing market for cars, clothes, luxury goods and electronics as its citizens become wealthier, and also an enormous manufacturing hub with relatively cheap labour and established supply chains.
But some executives are now wondering if their China dreams will ever come to fruition.
""China has not communicated an exit strategy. There's no end in sight, there's no sign of normal life returning,"" Steven Lynch from the British Chamber of Commerce said.

politics	Matt Hancock should not be reinstated as Tory MP, says party vice chair	"Lib Dem MP Helen Morgan and Tory vice-chair Nickie Aiken debate Matt Hancock's future
Matt Hancock should not be reinstated as a Tory MP following his appearance on ITV's I'm A Celebrity show, a Conservative vice-chair has said. 
Speaking to the BBC, Nickie Aiken said she didn't know what the ex-health secretary was planning to do next.
However, she added: ""Having seen what he's done in the jungle, he's maybe thinking about not coming back after the next election.""
Mr Hancock was suspended as a Tory MP after choosing to join the ITV show. 
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was ""very disappointed by the move"" but Mr Hancock defended the decision saying he wanted to ""show what I am like as a person"".
He has also vowed to donate part of his fee to charity. 
West Suffolk MP has now returned to the UK - his office says he has held a constituency surgery and is preparing for a parliamentary debate on his dyslexia bill on Friday.
A source close to the MP has said he intends to stay in politics.
But there are question marks over whether he will be able to stand as a Conservative in the next general election.
Conservative Party has asked all its MPs to confirm whether they intend to stand at the next election by 5 December.
Following his suspension, Mr Hancock will sit as an independent MP and is therefore currently unable to declare his interest in running again for the Conservatives. 
BBC has been told by a Conservative source that 5 December is not ""a hard and fast deadline"" so it is possible Mr Hancock could be readmitted to the party, and subsequently allowed to stand again.
Nadine Dorries was suspended from the Conservative Party in 2012 when she took part in the I'm A Celebrity programme, but had the whip restored after six months. 
Mr Hancock could also choose to run in West Suffolk as an independent candidate. 
Appearing on the BBC's Politics Live, Ms Aiken was asked if Mr Hancock should be let back into the Conservative Party. 
""No,"" she replied.
Asked if Mr Hancock should run again as an MP she said: ""We've all been asked to tell central office by Monday whether we want to stand again, and I don't know what Matt has decided to do. 
""But I would suggest that, having seen what he's done in the jungle, he's maybe thinking about not coming back after the next general election.""
Mr Hancock did receive support from Conservative MP Desmond Swayne, who said: ""Given the sheer spunk of the contribution that Matt Hancock has made to television, it would be churlish not to restore the whip, wouldn't it?""
Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats are proposing a motion that would prevent MPs from taking part in reality TV shows for weeks at a time while Parliament is in session, although it stands little chance of becoming law. 
Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine said: ""This Bushtucker Bill is designed to stop MPs following in Matt Hancock's shameful footsteps to the jungle."""
politics	We must wean economy off immigration, Labour leader warns businesses	"Sir Keir claims government keeps having ""sticking plaster"" answers to problems, rather than looking to the longer term.
f ""cheap labour"" must end to wean the UK off its ""immigration dependency"", Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has told business leaders.
Sir Keir called for a plan to train British workers and move the economy away from its ""low-pay model"".
But he accepted the need for skilled foreign workers and promised a ""pragmatic"" approach to immigration.
He later refused to commit to lower immigration overall, saying he was against a ""fixed number"".
Speaking to BBC political editor Chris Mason, he said under his approach levels would come down ""in some areas"" - but added: ""I don't want to hold back the skills that we need in this country.
""Over the last few years, we've had arbitrary figures plucked out of the air, and that hasn't worked for anyone,"" he said.
Labour leader's speech to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference comes at a time when businesses are calling for more migrant labour to boost economic growth.
His address to business figures in Birmingham followed that of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday.
Mr Sunak told business leaders having ""proper control of our borders"" was one of the immediate benefits of Brexit and said curbing illegal migration was the ""country's number one priority right now"".
He spoke after CBI director-general Tony Danker said the UK needed more foreign workers to drive economic growth as the country faces a deep recession.
""People are arguing against immigration - but it's the only thing that has increased our growth potential since March,"" Mr Danker said.
re was considerably less migration during the Covid-19 pandemic than in previous years and the number of EU citizens moving to the UK has dropped since the UK left the European Union.
Office for Budget Responsibility has forecasted a decline in net migration, with the number expected to settle at 205,000 a year from 2026 onwards.
Brexit is ""already delivering” benefits and opportunities for the UK, the prime minister says.
In his speech, Sir Keir set out what the UK's immigration policy would look like under a Labour government, should the party win the next general election.
He promised an immigration system that works better for the needs of business and recognises the need for skilled workers from abroad.
But he stressed that any changes to a points-based migration system ""will come with new conditions for business"".
""We will expect you to bring forward a clear plan for higher skills and more training, for better pay and conditions, for investment in new technology,"" he said.
""But our common goal must be to help the British economy off its immigration dependency. To start investing more in training up workers who are already here.""
Pressed on whether he wanted net migration to decrease, Sir Keir said he expected numbers to fall in areas that have been ""overly reliant"" on workers from abroad.
However, he added that he didn't want to hold businesses back if they need to employ talent from abroad. 
Sir Keir also said he would tackle NHS waiting lists and improve mental health support in order to help people get back into work.
""You can't tell me the number of older people falling out of work has nothing to do with the millions stuck on NHS waiting lists,"" he told the conference. 
Since the pandemic, one million people, mostly in their 50s, have left work making it harder for employers to find staff. 
Sir Keir outlined Labour's plans for reform including:
Asked if his own party supported the policies, Sir Keir said Labour had ""changed"" adding: ""We've turned Labour inside out.""
Sir Keir spoke about immigration in an interview with the BBC last week, saying the UK was recruiting too many people from overseas into the NHS.
Labour's leader appears to have a genuine belief that this is the best way to build sustainable economic growth.
Keir Starmer believes, we are told, that there needs to be a fundamental rethink that involves training the domestic workforce rather than relying on immigration.
But there is a political calculation too.
Sir Keir wants to persuade the old Labour heartlands which voted for Brexit that he understands some of the concerns about high levels of immigration.
He also wants to try and convince them he is serious about making Brexit work - without freedom of movement.
But not everyone in the Labour Party will agree with the tone or the substance of his speech.
rise of legal migration to the UK was one of the most prominent political issues in the country ahead of the EU referendum in 2016.
Former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron once promised to get immigration down to the tens of thousands a year.
Net migration - the difference between people coming to the UK and those leaving - has been over 200,000 since the late 1990s.
Under Sir Keir's leadership, Labour has ruled out a return to the EU single market, which guarantees citizens of member states the freedom to live and work anywhere in the bloc.
Labour's policy on Brexit has divided the party, with some calling for a much closer relationship with the EU on different terms.
Sir Keir's speech comes as Mr Sunak denied that ministers could look to realign the UK with EU laws.
Some Tories have been angered by suggestions the government was weighing up a Swiss-style relationship with the EU.
But the prime minister told the CBI conference on Monday that the UK ""will not pursue any relationship with Europe that relies on alignment with EU laws""."
politics	Flawed EU settlement scheme could create illegal migrants says High Court	"UK scheme to settle millions of EU citizens risks creating illegal migrants overnight and is unlawful, the High Court has ruled. 
In a highly critical judgment, the court said the scheme breached the UK's Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
watchdog for EU citizens' rights argued the scheme could strip people of rights if they don't register in time. 
Home Office said EU citizens are friends with clear protections and it will challenge the ruling. 
Since 2018, the Home Office has run a two-stage process for EU citizens who wanted to remain in the UK. 
me was set up because the EU's freedom of movement principle had meant many people from within the bloc had never needed permission to be in the UK under immigration laws that apply to other parts of the world. 
Under the scheme, at least 2.2 million people currently have ""pre-settled status"". This is a limited right to live and work in the UK and expires if they don't re-apply for full settled status after five years. 
Some 200,000 people, who were part of the scheme's pilot in 2018, must register for full settled status by August 2023 - or they could lose their legal rights. 
Independent Monitoring Authority (IMA), the post-Brexit watchdog for EU citizens' rights, challenged these arrangements in the High Court, saying ministers were breaking the legal promises they had given to the European Union.
It argued huge numbers of people could become illegal immigrants overnight if they didn't apply for the second stage on time. 
would mean they would lose their right to live, work or study and their access to health services. 
risk of that happening, its lawyers argued, had never been intended in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. 
, the High Court agreed, ruling the scheme created so much uncertainty it breached the UK's deal with the EU. 
Mr Justice Lane said a very large number of people could face serious uncertainty. 
""The consequence... of limited leave coming to an end, without being followed by further leave, is extremely serious,"" said the judge.
""The person concerned becomes an overstayer, who from that point is in the United Kingdom unlawfully. 
""A person who knowingly remains beyond the time limited by the leave commits a criminal offence. In my judgment, these consequences cannot be brushed aside as merely procedural matters.""
judge said that people who had not secured their full settled status would be at the mercy of the Home Office's decision-making. 
""Someone who makes a belated application for further leave [to remain] will not know whether the defendant will accept the late application,"" he said.
Dr Kathryn Chamberlain, the head of IMA, said the watchdog had asked the court to give people clarity before the first tranche of EU citizens approach the August 2023 deadline. 
""I am pleased that the judge has recognised the significant impact this issue could have had on the lives and livelihoods of citizens with pre-settled status in the UK,"" she said. 
But junior Home Office minister Lord Murray said the government was disappointed and planned to appeal. 
""EU citizens are our friends and neighbours, and we take our obligations to securing their rights in the UK very seriously,"" he said. 
""The EU Settlement Scheme goes above and beyond our obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement, protecting EU citizens' rights and giving them a route to settlement in the UK."""
politics	Keir Starmer: Immigration not quick fix to NHS problems	"Keir Starmer says the UK is recruiting too many people from overseas into the NHS
UK is recruiting too many people from overseas into the NHS, Sir Keir Starmer has said. 
Labour leader argued immigration was not the solution to a staffing crisis as he called for more recruitment from within the UK.
It came as new data revealed staffing issues were linked to two deaths at a Glasgow hospital in one month. 
Scottish Health Secretary Humza Yousaf expects this winter to be ""one of the most difficult NHS Scotland has faced"". 
About 6,000 nursing and midwifery posts are unfilled in Scotland's NHS, while the English health service is said to be facing its worst-ever staffing crisis.
In England, 34% of doctors joining the health service last year came from overseas - up from 18% in 2014. 
Scotland's SNP government is spending £8m on hiring 750 nurses and midwives from overseas this winter. 
Labour has pledged to take on an extra 7,500 medical students every year if the party wins the next general election. 
In an interview on BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show, Sir Keir said those people would be trained into the NHS ""from here"". 
Asked how many people he would be prepared to let into the country under a managed migration plan, he said: ""We don't want open borders. Freedom of movement has gone and it's not coming back.
""So that means fair rules, firm rules, a points-based system. 
""What I would like to see is the numbers go down in some areas. I think we're recruiting too many people from overseas into, for example, the health service. 
""But on the other hand, if we need high-skilled people in innovation in tech to set up factories etc, then I would encourage that.""
Labour leader said he has daily conversations with his wife Victoria, who works in the NHS, about the health service's struggles.
Asked what she says is the problem with the NHS, Sir Keir replied: ""We haven't got enough people.""
On whether he believes immigration should be used to address that issue, he said: ""I think that we should be training people in this country. 
""Of course we need some immigration but we need to train people in this country.""
Sir Keir's comments come after politicians and campaign groups criticised Home Secretary Suella Braverman's language about migrants. 
Meanwhile data obtained by Scottish Labour using freedom of information legislation shows 336 related to ""staffing/inappropriate skill mix"" were recorded by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde between July 18 and August 18. 
ude two deaths at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, while there were 59 ""near misses"" recorded across the health board.
A further 14 incidents caused illness or injury - 10 of which occurred at QEUH, according to the figures.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde confirmed investigations into the circumstances surrounding the two deaths were ongoing - but said the board could not  comment further due to patient confidentiality.
Paul O'Kane, Scottish Labour's public health spokesman, said: ""NHS workforce is overstretched and undervalued, and these terrifying figures are a glimpse of what will happen on a larger scale if the Scottish government's negligence continues.""
Humza Yousaf, the health secretary, said: ""The health service is facing a triple threat this winter - recovering from the worst effects of the pandemic, high energy costs and rising inflation, and the loss of much needed staff due to Brexit.
""Like health services across the UK and globally, we expect this winter to be one of the most difficult NHS Scotland has faced.""
He said the Scottish government's £600m health and care plan was working to recruit 1,000 new NHS staff, including up to 750 nurses, midwives and allied health professionals from overseas - with the plan also focusing on the social care sector to try to alleviate delays.
retary added that the government continues to ""take positive action to promote patient safety"", saying it had last month introduced the Patient Safety Commissioner Bill to Parliament.
""This legislation will further strengthen the patient voice within the healthcare system and take action to promote patient safety across our healthcare system as a whole,"" Mr Yousaf said.
Meanwhile a spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the Datix system - which collates data on adverse events - ""may not give an entirely accurate picture of the situation"", adding that on occasions where staffing issues are resolved quickly the system may not be updated.
He said: ""We would like to extend our sympathy to families who have lost a loved one in our hospitals.""

politics	Chinese bypass censors to remember Jiang Zemin	", spectacles and the word ""grandpa"" figure in posts by people in China as they remember the late Chinese leader Jiang Zemin and try to avoid the censors. 
Members of China's top leadership have never had individual accounts on local social media platforms and posts about them are routinely heavily filtered, to avoid people leaving messages critical of the Communist Party government.  
As a result, there has long been intense censorship of Jiang Zemin online.  
His death coincides with a wave of protests against the authorities' ""zero-Covid"" policy - an outpouring of frustration over frequent lockdowns, and some have chanted anti-government slogans.
Media posts about Mr Jiang's death show that millions of social media users have left comments - most of which are positive.  
But only a handful are available to view, and a search on Sina Weibo for ""Jiang Zemin"" only shows some 250 posts, all from government media accounts.  
Communist Party appears to want people to see comments from users wishing him ""a good journey"" to the afterlife. The majority of visible posts include a candle emoji, which is a common way of commemorating someone who has died.  
For users to talk at a more personal level about what he meant to them, they have had to coin nicknames.  
Historically, toad-related nicknames have become popular ways of referencing him, like ""Uncle Toad"".  
While these originally were a way of mocking or criticising the leader - much as there are people who compare President Xi Jinping to Winnie the Pooh - in recent years there has been a phenomenon of ""toad worship"" from Jiang fans. Users have posted pictures of amphibious creatures to speak about him nostalgically.
For years, social media platforms have tried to clamp down on toad- and frog-related messages. Very few such messages can consequently be found on the platforms  today. 
But some have circumvented censorship today by making croaking sounds to leave messages about the former leader.  
""Ribbit. Rest in peace,"" says one user, for example. 
Knowing that words that allude to Mr Jiang will likely be filtered, some web users have simply let pictures speak to mark his legacy.  
In the eastern city of Yangzhou, where Mr Jiang was born, social media users have posted floral tributes left outside historic buildings, apparently for Mr Jiang.
Some have posted a book cover that he features on, titled: ""The man who changed China"".  
Images are also to be found of Jiang Zemin's large, trademark glasses and the phrase ""Stay young, stay simple"". Some have posted emojis of sunglasses as a way of referencing him.  
As posts that contain the roman script rather than Chinese characters are less likely to be censored, many have posted simple messages saying ""RIP"", or ""Rest in peace"".  
However, a regular theme in such messages has been people mourning not just the end of his life, but the end of a bygone era.  
""RIP, looking back it was the best era; an era full of hope,"" says one user.  
""RIP, to you, and the era,"" says another.  
One goes further saying: ""I will miss you, because things are so bad now. RIP.""  
""Nucleic acid tests and quarantine cabins should not be the backdrop of this country, but self-confidence and openness. RIP,"" says one, posting a picture of Mr Jiang smiling with former western leaders.
Some have acknowledged that Jiang's animated expressions meant he was sometimes a figure of fun.  
""When I was in high school, I just liked to send memes [of Jiang] to my friends,"" says one Weibo user. ""It is only now that I understand and long for an era when things were gradually opening up, and everyone's eyes were shining.""  
Others have acknowledged that they've found they feel ""neither happy nor sad"" to hear of Jiang's death. ""As a politician, he was complicated, multi-faceted, and contradictory. It will be history that evaluates his rights and wrongs."" 
With the leader of the country such a strong presence in people's lives, a wildly popular nickname for Jiang when news broke of his death was ""Grandpa Jiang"". But a search for this today brings up the message ""According to relevant laws, regulations and policies, results for 'Grandpa Jiang' cannot be displayed."" 
""Grandpa"", however, is not censored, so floods of user comments about ""Grandpa Jiang"" can be seen.  
While many have posted how they feel sad to hear about the death of their ""grandpa"", some appear to have taken the word ""grandpa"" - which also means an older man in Chinese - as a metaphor for ""president"". 
Users appear to have done this to make comments critical of the country's current leader, President Xi Jinping.  
""There are good grandpas who open up to the outside world, and bad grandpas who close the country.""  
""Everyone misses him so much, will a certain 'grandpa' be jealous?"" one asks. "

politics	Speed limit cut won't hurt Wales' economy, says minister	"Warnings that lowering the speed limit from 30mph to 20mph will harm the economy have been ""discredited"", a Welsh government minister has said.
One of the government's own documents said longer journeys could cause a ""substantial"" economic disadvantage.
fault speed limit will be cut in built-up areas next September.
But deputy climate change minister Lee Waters said he did not believe it, adding that it would make the streets safer for walkers and cyclists.
Anywhere between 40 and 440 lives could be saved over 30 years, according to a government analysis, saying this would save money for the emergency services and could help the economy.
ument also warned that slower journeys for commuters and people who drive for a living meant its ""central estimate"" was an economic hit of £4.5bn over 30 years, but acknowledged there was ""significant uncertainty"" over the figure and ""active professional debate"" about how it was calculated.
Journeys are expected to be less than a minute longer on average, with the vast majority affected by less than two minutes.
Mr Waters said: ""The idea that being a minute later to get to school harms the economy, I just don't believe it, so I think the figures are discredited in my view and there's a movement to change that.
""Also it's going to save lives - we know it's going to save lives."" 
Separate research commissioned by the government found cutting the speed limit could save £100m in its first year alone.
Welsh Conservatives said 20mph speed limits should be at the discretion of councils, but should always be in place outside schools and playgrounds.
Welsh Conservative spokeswoman for transport, Natasha Asghar, said: ""Research is far from conclusive with studies showing 20mph limits could have a detrimental impact on issues such as public transport. 
""Labour need to get Wales moving again by dropping these dogmatic plans, ending the roadbuilding ban and investing in improved infrastructure for both public and private transport, rather than wage a war against drivers."" 
w was voted through by the Senedd in July and will change on 17 September 2023.
Mr Waters said it would be a ""big change"" initially, but people would get used to it quickly, as they did when seatbelts became compulsory.
Up to 7,700 miles (12,535km) of roads could be affected, although councils will be able to keep the old speed limits in some cases.
Caldicot in Monmouthshire has been a pilot zone for the 20mph limit.
uncil is restoring the 30mph limit on two sections of road after complaints about congestion.
Dan Thompson has been a taxi driver in the town for 16 years and said he saw traffic get ""a lot worse"".
""Literally overnight, the moment it went to 20 miles an hour is when the sheer volumes of traffic started to build up.""
He said the speed limit should be targeted, so it drops to 20mph when children are going to and from school, rising back to 30mph during the day.
Durand Primary School children have been tracking how far they walk to school, and pupils in Year Six said slower traffic made them feel safe. 
Olly said: ""It's a lot safer to cross the road when you're walking by yourself.""
""It's safer around pedestrianised areas with slower speed limits,"" Alex said.
Molly added: ""If I'm walking alone to somewhere it's going to be much more safe."""
politics	Northern Ireland Protocol: Poots denies letter tried to dilute bill	"former Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots has dismissed a report that he tried to dilute the Northern Ireland Protocol bill.
x-DUP leader responded to a Financial Times article which suggested he wrote to the government to argue Northern Ireland's farmers would be better off under the protocol.
DUP has blocked Northern Ireland's executive and assembly from forming in its protest against the protocol.
Mr Poots has said he supports the bill.
He added the legislation, which would override parts of the protocol, is ""necessary to deal with the constitutional and economic damage being done to Northern Ireland"".
rotocol keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU's single market for goods to ensure free trade can continue across the Irish land border post-Brexit. 
It has, however, in turn angered unionist politicians by adding new checks to some goods being moved between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
DUP has said this undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional position and the party has, since February, withheld its support for the formation of Stormont's governing executive.
rty said there appears to be ""some people in London who mischievously are out to cast doubt on the DUP's determination to get rid of the NI Protocol - their tactics will fail"". 
""The party did not at any time consider tabling amendments to the bill to reflect anything contained in the letter which was sent by Mr Poots in his ministerial rather than party capacity and which was never discussed by the party,"" it added.
On Friday, it was reported that Mr Poots wrote to the then-UK environment, food and rural affairs secretary, George Eustice.
It said Mr Poots argued it was ""unacceptable"" that the protocol bill would force farmers to accept the same agricultural subsidy as the rest of the UK.
In response, Mr Poots has said he ""reasonably suggested one change which would maximise the UK's ability to use state aid under World Trade Organisation rules"".
A new subsidy system is expected to come fully into force in the UK from 4 January, which is designed to allow the devolved regions to deliver subsidies tailored for their needs.
wspaper reported that Mr Poots could not recall if he received a response from London.
UK government and the EU resumed talks in recent weeks about the protocol, while the legislation continues to progress through parliament. 
raditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister accused Mr Poots of putting ""expediency before principle"" by writing the letter, to which Mr Poots replied ""it does not dilute the bill in any way, on the contrary it makes it better""."
politics	Suspended Tory MP David Warburton breached code of conduct	"An MP breached Parliament's code of conduct over a £150,000 loan from a Russian-born businessman, a watchdog has ruled.
David Warburton failed to declare a loan given to him by Roman Joukovski via an off-shore trust while lobbying for the businessman.
He will avoid punishment after apologising for breaking the rules.
Mr Warburton lost the Conservative party whip in April after he was accused of sexual misconduct.
He previously told the BBC he had done nothing wrong.
An investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found Mr Warburton received the loan from a foundation based in the Seychelles linked to Mr Joukovski on August 2017.  
Mr Warburton said the money was a commercial loan provided on ""non-preferential terms"", which he paid back by March 2022.
Mr Warburton told the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, that he did not register the loan at the time because it was ""entirely unconnected with either my role as an MP or any parliamentary activities"".
""in no way"" ever ""influenced my words or actions as a Member"" he added in his submission to the commissioner.
After taking the loan, Mr Warburton wrote to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), urging the regulator to reconsider its assessment of Mr Joukovski after refusing to certify him as a fit or proper person.
Ms Stone said she was satisfied the loan had ""not influenced"" Mr Warburton words or actions as an MP - but ruled that it should still have been declared in the register of members' interests.
She found there had been two breaches of the MPs Code of Conduct. But the breaches were rectified after Mr Warburton wrote to the commissioner ""acknowledging and apologising for the breach"", Ms Stone ruled.
He has also agreed to add the loan to the MPs Register of Financial Interests.
Mr Warburton, who is 57, was first elected as the MP for Somerton and Frome in 2015."
politics	UK yet to see full impact of Brexit trade deals, says minister Badenoch	"full impact of Brexit on trade is ""yet to be seen"", International Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch has said.
Speaking to MPs, she acknowledged ""all change is difficult"" but said the UK could benefit from making its own trade deals with other countries. 
minister also defended the UK's deal with Australia, against fierce criticism from former Environment Secretary George Eustice.
Earlier this month, he accused the government of giving away ""too much"".
Ms Badenoch said she disagreed and that it wasn't right to talk as if the agreement would ""ruin our economy"".
""The deal isn't even in place yet and we're already talking it down,"" she told the international trade committee.
free trade agreement with Australia was the first post-Brexit deal negotiated from scratch. 
Leaving the EU gave the UK the freedom to negotiate its own trade deals, and since Brexit, the UK has signed agreements with 71 countries.
However, the majority of these are simply ""rollovers"" - meaning they copied the terms of deals the UK previously had when it was an EU member, rather than creating new trading arrangements.
Ms Badenoch argued that Brexit gave the UK the opportunity to pursue deals with growing markets in Asia-Pacific. 
However, the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has recently warned that Brexit was having a ""significantly adverse impact"" on UK trade.
During a question session with the International Trade Committee, Ms Badenoch was pressed on the impact of Brexit on the UK's trade performance, with Conservative Mark Garnier expressing concern that the UK had lower export figures than other advanced economies. 
Ms Badenoch acknowledge that, on exports, the UK ""should be doing better"" but was recovering from global factors such as Covid and the war in Ukraine. 
She argued the UK only fully left the EU at the beginning of 2020 and that ""the full impact of what we're going to see post-Brexit and all of the free trade agreements is yet to be seen.""
""There is a whole world out there - just looking inward and saying 'there is nothing happening except in the EU' is just not realistic.
""It's the 21st century and other countries all across the globe are growing - we need to strengthen our relationships with them, not pretend they don't exist."" 
Earlier this month, Mr Eustice strongly attacked the UK's agreement with Australia, accusing the government of giving ""far too much for far too little in return"".
He argued that then-International Trade Secretary Liz Truss had put the UK ""on the back foot"" by insisting the terms of a deal had to be agreed before a G7 summit in June  2021.
Asked about her colleague's comments, Ms Badenoch said she disagreed with ""almost all"" of Mr Eustice's arguments and insisted the UK hadn't ""given anything away"".
She attacked critics of the deal adding that the UK was ""barely getting through the Australia deal, with all the negativity we are getting"".
However, she did agree with Mr Eustice about the danger of setting hard deadlines for achieving trade deals.
She told the committee she had differed from Ms Truss, when she was prime minister, over the need to reach a free trade agreement with India by Diwali. 
She said the current Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, concurred with her about the need for ""quality over speed"" during trade negotiations. 
On the possibility of reaching a trade agreement with the US, Ms Badenoch said President Joe Biden had been clear he didn't want to do a deal with any country.
""That is not about the UK,"" she said adding that the two countries could still work together on removing tariffs, despite the absence of an agreement.
minister sought to downplay the importance of free trade agreements, arguing that it didn't in itself mean trade couldn't take place. 
""I would like us to move away from the Department for International Trade being seen as the department for free trade agreements and back to the department for international trade,"" she said."

sports	Georgina Roberts: Shooting's absence from Commonwealth Games 'a real blow'	"Welsh trap shooter Georgina Roberts is hoping to put her Commonwealth Games disappointment behind her at the first ISSF World Cup event of the year.
Roberts fulfilled selection criteria, but the 2022 Games in Birmingham will be without shooting for the first time since 1970 in Edinburgh.
24-year-old instead now travels to Cyprus to try the new World Cup format.
""Birmingham 2022 would have been my first Games and shooting not being involved was a real blow,"" she said.
""It would have been at a range we've been training at so the chances for myself and other teammates medalling would have been incredibly high.
""It's such a shame to have wasted that opportunity.""
India had originally threatened to boycott the Games if shooting wasn't included - even offering to host the shooting and archery competitions themselves - before abandoning the plan due to Covid-19 in July 2021.
Of Wales' 36 medals at the 2018 Games in Gold Coast, five were won in shooting events - the same haul as in athletics and swimming, and one less than cycling events. 
Despite her disappointment, the Mold shooter is keeping focused on her next goals.
week's event in Cyprus sees a change of format with competitors shooting at 125 targets across three days of qualifying.
rs then progress to the semi-finals and final, which take place on the third day.
""This year is now about ramping up to Paris 2024 [Olympics],"" said Roberts.
""We've got to work towards getting a place for that and then focus on the ultimate goal, an Olympic gold medal.
""All we can do is be positive for the future, keep working towards how we can champion our sport so next time we're likely to be back at the Commonwealth Games.""
Roberts' first competition win was in Malaga back in January 2020, and Roberts is keen to get back on track with her lofty ambitions.
""I'm a very optimistic and ambitious person,"" she added.
""Olympic gold is my dream and if I could do it in Paris I'd be the happiest person in the world.
""I think the thing I love about our sport is longevity, there's no age limit you can continue to go and medal at the Olympics, some have gone into their 50s.
""I want a final, I want a medal and I want a gold in Paris, but it's the getting there the really hard part.
""I'm hoping that, if I get there, I can medal and qualify got Los Angeles [2028] and future Olympic Games after that."""

sports	URC: Edinburgh 25-32 Glasgow Warriors - Horne stars as visitors win 1872 Cup	"Glasgow Warriors beat Edinburgh 32-25 to secure a second United Rugby Championship win over their Scottish rivals and the 1872 Cup.
Emiliano Boffelli kicked the hosts into an eight-point lead at the break after two tries for each team, Jamie Ritchie and Luke Crosbie for Edinburgh and Kyle Steyn and Matt Fagerson for Glasgow.
m Jordan's converted try and 13 points from George Horne put Warriors back in front and ensured them a bonus point, Patrick Harrison replying for Edinburgh.
Warriors, who won 16-10 last Friday, move up a place to fifth in the league.
Edinburgh were so passive for so long in round one at Scotstoun that there was only way for them to go in round two. After three losses in a row in the URC they desperately needed a victory to get themselves back up the table.
It did not start well for them and it finished nightmarishly but in between they had good moments and a handsome lead before their demons swooped and destroyed them.
Having come into this full of fire and brimstone they shipped an early try. Sione Tuipulotu was immense all night, even when Glasgow toiled for the first 40.
re gave the visitors good field position with a big line break. Glasgow worked it right, then left, Steyn's footwork proving too much for a flimsy Edinburgh defence. Jordan's conversion made it 7-0 and Mike Blair's team were back in bother.
r discomfort did not last long. They found an aggression and a control that garnered 17 points without reply. Home-free? One might have thought so.
Glasgow were not at the races in that period. Edinburgh got their first try after Ali Price was charged down while attempting a box kick in his own 22. His team-mates were sluggish in trying to claim the loose ball and when the hosts jumped on it, Ritchie soon ploughed over. Boffelli, inevitably, fired over the conversion.
Argentine added a penalty to make it 10-7, The gap would have been wider had Sebastian Cancelliere not done wonderfully well to get under Duhan van der Merwe over the try line.
r pressure did tell in the end, though. Glasgow, as passive in the first half here as they were steely last week, could not defend a driven lineout, Crosbie crashing over with Boffelli landing a beauty of a conversion from out wide. The crowd of more than 25,000 were lapping it up.
re was an occasional sign of life from Glasgow, normally provided by the dump truck Tuipulotu. Another surge, where Edinburgh bounced off him as if he was a human wall, took Glasgow downfield and they stayed there until Fagerson scored from a smart play off a lineout.
Boffelli put over a penalty just before the break. Edinburgh should have been further ahead and, given their history this season, eight points was a precarious advantage.
Blair's side have had a wretched habit of coughing up decent leads and the ghost of defeats revisited them when Glasgow suddenly got a foothold.
Just before the hour they scored their third try from not far off their third proper attack. It was a pearler. Richie Gray, Sione Vailanu and Cancelliere combined at pace down the right. The wing then put in Jordan for the score, the fly-half then landing the conversion to make it 20-19.
Glasgow now had the bit between their teeth, the momentum completely shifting in their favour. They hit the lead with 13 minutes left with a Horne penalty, given away by Marshall Sykes under his own posts. Sykes was yellow carded for good measure.
Another Edinburgh collapse? Not half. Just as they were gathering their senses having fallen behind, they conceded again. Again it was the outstanding Tuipulotu in the thick of it. His grubber was seized on by Steyn, who gathered, ran on and fed his support runner. Horne took the key pass from Jordan and ran away to score. A ruthless finish from a player who had a seismic influence when he replaced Price.
Edinburgh were stunned. Horne added another penalty to bring his own haul to 13 points in seven spectacular minutes. From there, they never looked like showing the weakness in their game that Edinburgh showed in theirs. Harrison sneaked over on the right to give Edinburgh some comfort.
re hugely encouraging days for Franco Smith's side and enormously worrying times for Edinburgh, who are now on a grim run of four URC losses in a row.
Edinburgh head coach Mike Blair: ""It was really disappointing to see what happened in the second half. Glasgow got on top from a physicality point of view and we struggled.
""The tightness of the league means that if you do get on a run, you're back in the play-off positions. We need to keep that belief. This has been a tough period for us - lots of guys have played five games on the bounce. We'll have to look at freshening things up.""
Glasgow head coach Franco Smith: ""It was fantastic. Everybody has chipped in and worked really hard. There's a lot of belief now. We fought well. The character of the boys - if we play to our strengths, we are a dangerous team.
""[Sione Tuipulotu] was really good. He's put up his hand for a lot of responsibility this season and he led the charge.""

sports	World Cup 2022: Giant Wales bucket hat unveiled in Doha	"A Welsh delegation will visit Qatar in the new year as the Welsh FA wants to ""help make the world a better place"", according to its chief executive.  
Noel Mooney said the team ""will not just pack up our tent"" at the end of the World Cup but play a continuing role in tackling issues in the country. 
His comments were made in Doha at the unveiling of a giant Welsh bucket hat.
First Minister Mark Drakeford and Welsh sport ambassadors Jess Fishlock and Colin Jackson were also at the event. 
More than 2,500 Wales fans are expected to be at Monday's opening match against the USA, marking Wales' return to the tournament after a 64 year absence. 
untry has been criticised for human rights concerns, including for its treatment of LGBTQ+ people and migrant workers.
At Sunday's unveiling, Mr Mooney said Qatar wanted to be ""a leader in the region for all these issues"" and legislative progress has occurred in the last few months on legacy funding, help for the families of workers who died, and a migrant centre. 
He said Wales would play its part through UEFA, adding: ""Just to be clear, we will be back here in January. 
""We won't just pack up our tent at the end of the tournament and go home to Cymru, we want to help make the world a better place."" 
Mr Mooney said the team ""really fancy our chances in this [World Cup] group"", adding ""we have a really good side"".
But he was quick to point out the tournament was about far more than football for the nation. 
It is not just the players being showcased to the globe but the culture and language, he said. 
""The bucket hat carries the words Gorau Chwarae, Cyd Chwarae [the team's moto - 'best play is team play'] and Ben Davies spoke in Welsh at a World Cup press conference for the first time ever yesterday. 
""It feels like a Gwyl Cymru [Welsh festival] is happening.""
For the first minister, it was more important to be in Qatar than not. 
Mr Drakeford's visit to the World Cup has drawn criticism, but he said the bucket hat ""will be seen by thousands and thousands of people from around the world in the coming weeks and is a symbol of the fact Wales are here, which is very important to us as a small nation"". 
He said the World Cup would ""take the name of Wales into living rooms across the world, many of which would never have heard of Wales before"".
""So it's an incredible opportunity to explain to people what we are as a nation - an outward looking nation where rights matter.""
Mr Drakeford flew in Saturday night and said he had not seen anything to concern him in ""the very brief time I have been here"".
""As I said in the run-up to coming here, there are concerns and reservations you have to take seriously,"" he said.
""But, in the end, we decided being here was more important.""
Mr Drakeford added: ""When you see the Welsh flag flying with the other 31, and those countries are all represented, it is important we are also here.""
He said he has a number of meetings with ""very senior people"" in the business industry planned and would be building ""major cultural relationships"" on his two day visit. 
Asked what the tangible benefits are of government delegations going to events such as this and the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, he said they are never known at the time but ""realised some months after when orders come through to Welsh companies and they have trade opportunities"". 
He said £2m spent on promoting Wales in Qatar would be returned ""many, many times over"", with the tournament creating huge exposure.
He also described the bucket hat as ""not just a work of art but with a very practical use as well"". 
""If you are at Heathrow Airport and lost and spot a bucket hat,"" he joked, ""then follow it and you can be sure you will end up in Doha.""
first minister will meet the Wales squad later on Sunday with a simple message. 
""I will tell them no pressure at all,"" he said.
""You are here to play football and to dare to dream, to go further if you can, but being here is the most important thing, an enormous achievement, and I hope the team spirit will sustain them through."" 
Legendary striker Ian Rush described Euro 2016 as ""special"" and that he wanted Wales on the biggest stage to become a regular occurrence. 
""I'm looking forward to seeing all the fans here, and singing,"" he said."

Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) said the athletes with ""ties to the Olympic movement"" had arrived in recent months following a 12-month project to bring them to safety.
In all, 31 family members have resettled in the country since June. 
""It's been a journey for me but I am very happy to be here,"" said Yousofi. 
""I am essentially starting a new life here.""
Sprinter Yousofi, 26, carried Afghanistan's flag at the opening ceremony of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games - which were postponed until last year because of the coronavirus pandemic - and took part in the women's 100m event. 
She is now hoping to compete at the Paris Olympics in 2024. 
""I am going to be training very hard, it would be exciting to go to Paris,"" she added.
Asian Games taekwondo medallist Ahmad Abasy was also part of the group relocated down under.
AOC liaised with the Australian government to secure visas and flights for the Afghan arrivals, while the International Olympic Committee (IOC) provided financial support during their time in interim locations.
""For the families involved, the stress and uncertainty over this time has been enormous,"" said AOC chief executive Matt Carroll. 
""Many have spent time in locations outside Afghanistan and it's wonderful to now have them on Australian soil. All arrived happy, if exhausted.
""These brave people have endured significant hardship and we are so pleased that our efforts have been successful.""
Australia evacuated more than 70 Afghan athletes, family members and officials a year ago as the Taliban came into power. 
Girls' and women's sport has since been suppressed by the Taliban government's hardline policies."
sports	UFC 281: Molly McCann aiming to end breakout year with third win	"Molly McCann has been one of the breakout fighters in the UFC this year - inside and outside the octagon.
32-year-old from Liverpool has provided two sensational spinning back elbow wins this year with triumphs over Luana Carolina in March and Hannah Goldy in July.
Both victories have seen 'Meatball' become one of the most recognisable names in the UFC.
""It's absolutely been mind-blowing, the love and appreciation and gratitude I've received around the world,"" McCann told BBC Sport.
""I'm not just talking Liverpool, I'm not just talking Ireland, everywhere I go people are just running at me and they just do the spinny elbow.""
McCann could make it three wins in a calendar year on Saturday with a victory against Erin Blanchfield in New York at UFC 281.
But the flyweight's extraordinary rise did not happen overnight.
McCann's journey in mixed martial arts started in 2013, but after two successive losses between 2020 to 2021 she considered her future in the sport. 
""To get the performances I've dreamed of and to put into practice the years of hard work is very special, and to have the recognition for what I've done is just boss,"" she said.
""It's set me up for where I'm supposed to be. I feel where I am in my fight IQ, I'm coming to my prime now and the notoriety is in alignment to that.""
However, McCann's success has come at a price and she admits to having struggled to adjust to the new heights of fame.
""Nothing teaches you how you can't walk down the street anymore and not be noticed, and not have a minute to yourself, and to make sure you are being who you need to be,"" McCann said.
""It hasn't been very easy at all. I've had to speak to a lot of people, I've had to work really hard because you can't be you anymore and I am public property now. 
""I'm 32 and for that to happen this late in the game is mad.""
McCann, who has 481,000 followers on Instagram, added: ""It's just taken a bit of time to understand that, and to know it shouldn't be a burden. 
""I've worked my whole life for this but you don't ask for fame, you ask for a world title, but with the fame - I don't like to say fame, I mean notoriety - I'm able to make a change and do things so you have to take the rough with the smooth.""
McCann, currently ranked 15 in the flyweight division, will fight at the iconic Madison Square Garden - something she envisioned when she attended Katie Taylor's victory over Amanda Serrano in April.
""Anyone who comes from boxing knows the importance of this arena,"" she said.
""I'm literally staying in a hotel in the middle of Times Square - sometimes it's a bit nuts to think this girl from Norris Green has absolutely made it to Madison Square Garden, so I'm just buzzing.""  
""It's always been my dream since I was a little meatball to fight at MSG, and when I was in there, when I watched the walkouts and took it in, it completely blew me away.
""I've got a picture standing outside, after the event, with my partner, and I was like 'that's going to be me one day', and low and behold, six months later, here we go.""
McCann's fight with Blanchfield is one of many intriguing fights taking place in New York.
At the top of the card is middleweight champion Israel Adesanya's highly-anticipated fight against Alex Pereira.
mpionship fight is a resuming of hostilities between the old rivals, who fought twice before in kickboxing. Pereira won both those encounters.
Brazilian Pereira is unbeaten in his three UFC fights and was fast-tracked to a title shot with Adesanya dominating the division since becoming champion in 2019.
Also in action is lightweight contender Dustin Poirier who faces former Bellator lightweight champion Michael Chandler in a mouthwatering clash.
Poirier, who has won seven fights from his last nine told BBC Sport he was relishing the opportunity to face Chandler and will not be underestimating him.
""He's very dangerous, big punches, a lot of power, super explosive, good wrestling, very high-level experience, he's very dangerous for sure,"" Poirier said.
Poirier, 33 is coming off a loss to former champion Charles Oliveira after two wins over Conor McGregor.
A win against Chandler will firmly put Poirier in the title picture again but 'The Diamond' isn't looking past his opponent on Saturday.
""I don't look too far ahead you know, you got to live in the now,"" he said."

sports	Global Solo Challenge: Sailor Dafydd Hughes' non-stop sea voyage	"A sailor is aiming to become only the second Welshman to go by sea single-handed and non-stop around the world. 
Dafydd Hughes, 62, from Tal-y-bont, Ceredigion, has registered to take part in 2023's Global Solo Challenge - a round-the-world sailing race. 
rts in A Coruña in Spain and sailors must travel east, passing between Antarctica and capes in South Africa, Australia and South America. 
He said he expected the voyage to take him more than six months. 
Completing the circumnavigation of the globe would see him follow Alex Thomson, from Bangor, who became the fastest Briton to sail solo, non-stop and unassisted around the world in 2017. 
Mr Thomson completed the journey in just under 75 days. 
Mr Hughes's boat, named Bendigedig - which means wonderful or fantastic in Welsh - has only just returned to the water after 20 years on dry land.
He bought it two years ago and has been working to make it seaworthy since. 
He said: ""She's had a full refit. She was completely stripped out when I bought her and she's now been fully rewired, fully plumbed, new tanks, new masts, all the deck fittings are new, the running rigs are new, new sails - so she's basically a new boat.""
34-ft (10m) vessel was ideal for the 26,000 nautical mile journey, Mr Hughes said. 
He has previously sailed around the world, as part of Sir Robin Knox-Johnston's crew in 2007, but doing it solo will be a challenge on an entirely new level. 
""When I first read about the race, I filled in my entry form within an hour. I sent it off and then I thought 'Oh my word what have I done now?' But I haven't lost the commitment since that day,"" he added. 
He said his biggest fear was a breaking wave on the side of the boat, with waves in the Southern Ocean reaching 60 or 70ft (20 to 23m), enough to roll the boat.
Bendigedig has been lowered into Aberaeron harbour and he will take it out to sea to test for just over two weeks it before taking on the Global Solo Challenge. 
Mr Hughes's sister, Sian Campion, said he was always looking for a challenge and was fond of an ""adrenaline rush"", and ""if he gets an idea in his mind he'll see it through until the end"". 
""He was keen on Formula 1 and had his own go-kart and went to races, he used to ride his bike or climb trees, he always had a craving for speed,"" she said. 
Global Solo Challenge, which is a new event, will start in September 2023. 
Entrants must head south from A Coruña and ""leave the Antarctic region and all known ice… to starboard (on the right) and the three great capes to port (on the left) before making their way to the finish line"".
ree capes are the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, Cape Leeuwin in Australia and Cape Horn in South America.
Mr Hughes said only 180 people have ever sailed around the world solo, fewer than the 600 who have been to space. 
He will not be allowed to be helped but will keep in touch with a shore team via satellite phone. 
He will also get lots of support from members of Aberaeron Yacht Club.

sports	NBA: Kyrie Irving buzzer-beater gives Brooklyn Nets win at Toronto Raptors	"Kyrie Irving hit a game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer to give the Brooklyn Nets a 119-116 win at the Toronto Raptors in Friday's NBA action.
was the Nets' fifth straight win - a ninth out of 10 - while LeBron James led the Los Angeles Lakers to victory.
Elsewhere, the Golden State Warriors lost again without Stephen Curry.
""Who would have thought I would come into Toronto and hit my first game-winning buzzer-beater of my career?"" said Irving, who scored 32 points.
""Pray that there's more in the future, but I'm glad that we got this win.""
Nets coach Jacque Vaughn had originally drawn up the game-winning play for forward Kevin Durant, but they switched it to Irving as the team was coming out of its final timeout.
""It just comes with the trust that we're building here,"" said Irving.
""Jacque had a play call that we were about to go execute, and me and K had some dialogue and we decided to run the play for me. It was a good match-up versus Fred [VanVleet]. We just got the better of him that one time.
""I just want to be great in those situations,"" Irving added. ""You can say anything you want about me not hitting shots in the past, but the one time when you step up and make it, those are the ones you want to remember.""
Durant, who added 28 points for the Nets, said of Irving: ""He was already cooking, so I didn't want to get in his way.
""We kept finding him late in the game. He made some big shots, and I was just like, 'Jacque, I think Ky should take this one.'""
Elsewhere, James scored 30 points as the Los Angeles Lakers overcame a first-half injury to Anthony Davis to earn a 126-108 win over the Denver Nuggets.
mas Bryant scored 21 points for the Lakers and Russell Westbrook had a triple-double of 15 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists as the hosts ended Denver's three-game winning streak.

sports	Rugby World Cup: What next for England and the women's game?	"England captain Sarah Hunter said the latest Rugby World Cup made her feel like ""finally people are just waking up to how great our sport is"".
Rugby Football Union chief executive Bill Sweeney agreed, saying the nail-biting final was ""probably more entertaining than the men's game"".
urnament in New Zealand was the best-attended women's World Cup ever, breaking the attendance record for a women's matchday twice - the opening-day attendance of 34,235 surpassed by the 42,579 sell-out Eden Park crowd for the final.
A turning point for women's rugby, but there is more to come.
Here, BBC Sport explores some of the main questions concerning the future of the game and England's team after their fifth World Cup final loss to New Zealand.
None of the Red Roses have announced their retirement since the final, but 37-year-old Hunter has already confirmed she will stop playing before a home World Cup in 2025.
Abbie Ward - a key player in England's formidable line-out - says she will ""100%"" continue until the next World Cup, while star centre Emily Scarratt, who is 32, is undecided.
She said losing a second successive final to New Zealand was ""certainly a driving force to win a World Cup"".
Scarratt said: ""I said to my mum when I saw her and gave her a big hug: 'Brace yourself, we might have to do another three years of this.'
""It's definitely not a decision to be made now. We'll see.""
Head coach Simon Middleton has also lost two World Cup finals in a row, and he is yet to confirm whether he wants to stay at the helm.
Middleton, whose reign has included a record 30-Test winning streak and four successive Six Nations titles, has a contract until the end of the 2023 Women's Six Nations.
Sweeney told BBC Radio 5 Live it was ""important to have some continuity"" after the World Cup, adding it ""would be good to have a woman"" leading England ""at some point"".
He said there was ""a raft of coaches"" on the RFU's radar to succeed Middleton and confirmed he would discuss the head coach's future when he is back in England.
RFU has led the way in investing in women's rugby since giving the Red Roses full-time contracts in 2019.
Other sides, including Wales and New Zealand, are now following suit in making their women's teams professional.
Black Ferns were only given contracts earlier this year, and Sweeney said it was ""a bit disappointing"" they won the World Cup despite a comparative lack of investment.
With the game still growing, both the Red Roses and the World Cup in New Zealand were run at a loss.
But Sweeney said England's final loss ""won't change the views on investment"", adding 70% of the fans at Eden Park on Saturday were new followers for New Zealand Rugby and women's rugby ""is good for the overall health of the game"".
World Rugby chief executive Alan Gilpin said the success of the tournament in New Zealand had ""given us confidence to invest more"".
In two weeks, England's players can return to play for their clubs in the Premier 15s - the most competitive women's domestic league in the world, which is also benefiting from increased RFU investment.
r next international outing will be in the 2023 Women's Six Nations, which starts on 26 March 2023.
In that tournament, England will tour the country as they play in Newcastle and Northampton before a first standalone fixture at Twickenham against France in what is likely to be the decider.
About 20,000 tickets have been sold for the Twickenham game, and Sweeney is confident that number will reach 40,000 - half the stadium's capacity.
RFU is also hopeful it can host World Rugby's new women's competition WXV in 2024, in preparation for a home World Cup in 2025.
Sweeney is aiming for the 2025 World Cup to break even and says ""we will fill Twickenham"" for the final ""and hopefully for the semi-final as well"".
Before that, the plan is to host matches in different regions around the country in what Sweeney says will be ""the best ever women's World Cup""."

Siobhan McGrath's early goal helped Galway side Sarsfields into an five-point lead but Loughgiel hit back.
Caitrin Dobbin netted and the teams were level at the break before Sarsfield burst clear with Rachel Murray firing in their second goal.
Loughgiel rallied again to equalise but Sarsfields finished strongly to win.
Earlier on Saturday at Croke Park, Down club Clonduff claimed the All-Ireland Intermediate title with a 0-12 to 1-6 victory over Kilkenny side James Stephens. 
Paula O'Hagan and Sara Louise Graffin combined for nine of Clonduff's scores as the Shamrocks secured the trophy for the second time, four years after the first.
It was a see-saw decider at headquarters with the outstanding Roisin McCormick firing over eight points for Loughgiel while the McGrath sisters - Siobhan and Niamh - were instrumental in Sarsfields securing their third All-Ireland crown.
Sarsfields made a blistering start with Siobhan McGrath shooting low into the net in the first minute and she added a point after team-mate Caoimhe Kelly slotted between the posts.
Mary McKillen put Loughgiel on the scoreboard and Niamh McGarth restored the five-point margin before the Ulster champions produced a run of 1-4 without reply, starting with points from Lucia McNaughton and McCormick.
Dobbin ran through before rifling into the bottom corner on 28 minutes and an Annie Lynn double left Loughgiel two points in front.
Kelly pulled one back and Klara Donohue registered the last point of the half to make it 1-6 to 1-6 at the break. 
McCormick edged Loughgiel back into the lead on the restart before Sarsfields seized control again with a 1-3 burst.
Siobhan McGarth and Shannon Corcoran flighted over before Murray blasted into the net, with the goal followed by a Niamh McGrath point.
Loughgiel showed spirit by wiping out another five-point deficit - four of the scores came from McCormick while Dobbin also pointed.
Siobhan McGrath and McCormick exchanged points before Sarsfields produced the decisive thrust with four straight points.
Player-of the-match Niamh McGrath bagged two with Siobhan McGrath and Sarah Spellman also slotting over.
McCormick made it eight points from eight frees to give Loughgiel a glimmer of hope but Sarsfields saw out the final minutes to earn a three-point success."

11-4 winner jumped the last just ahead but L'Homme Presse unseated jockey Charlie Deutsch on landing to leave the way clear.
wed Bravemansgame and jockey Harry Cobden, a winner on Clan Des Obeaux in 2018, to win by 14 lengths.
Royale Pagaille ran on for second with former winner Frodon third. 
Bravemansgame won the Kauto Star Novices' Chase on this day last season and marked his seasonal reappearance with victory in the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby with Nicholls always targeting this race for the seven-year-old.
Although Frodon was at the head of the field for much of the three-mile race, he started to fade turning from home, leaving Bravemansgame and L'Homme Presse to lead the way.
L'Homme Presse held a narrow advantage approaching the third fence from the finish, but Bravemansgame mastered him between the last two and took command.
Nicholls confirmed Bravemansgame would now head straight to March's Gold Cup at Cheltenham.
He said: ""It was a hell of a race. They went a good gallop and old Frodon gave them a good lead. He stayed on strong then and showed his strengths. He is just a maturing horse and we have trained him for today.
""We will go straight to Cheltenham now and we won't run him before the Gold Cup. On better ground he travels better than he did today, but he dug deep and stayed on. 
""The other horse was a little unfortunate to lose his pilot, but he was beaten by then.
""I'm thrilled. Who knows [what would have happened if L'Homme Presse had not come to grief at the last], but he wasn't stopping. He just jumped to the front and he would have been hard to go by. You can never be certain, but it looked that way to me watching. 
""I'm lucky enough to have the horses good enough to do it and the capability of a team that is good enough to get them right on the day.""
Earlier, Champion Hurdle favourite Constitution Hill earned a comfortable win in the Christmas Hurdle.
One of National Hunt's current stars, who went off at 1-7 under Nico de Boinville, was never troubled as he backed up his easy win in the Fighting Fifth at Newcastle last month with a 17-length win over stable-mate Epitante.
It was a fourth Grade One success for the five-year-old and an 11th win in the race for trainer Nicky Henderson.
""That was only his fifth race and again it was everything you'd hoped for,"" said Henderson.
""You just have to pray it all goes right. It's not that easy. It's not just a matter of going out there and coming back; you've got to jump hurdles and be in good shape - which he is - but so was Epatante, I haven't seen her look better.
""Aidan said she's probably run better than when she won this on the bridle last year, but he said he was only chasing shadows so it shows you what he is achieving - it's frightening really.""
Earlier, Paisley Park put in a strong finish to claim his third Long Walk Hurdle.
9-2 chance, who turns 11 on New Year's Day, struggled at one point and seemed to be out of contention.
But as the leading two Champ and Goshen looked to fight it out, Paisley Park found a second wind under Aidan Coleman to race clear.
Grade One race was scheduled to be held at Ascot earlier this month but was rescheduled because of bad weather.
""We didn't know what to expect but Aidan was calm,"" assistant trainer Barry Fenton told ITV Racing. ""He was a bit cold over the first two hurdles but I was happy going to the third last. 
""He kept plugging away and he's an unbelievable horse."""

And, while 2022 has been disappointing, a training block with coach Ivan Lendl in Florida has convinced him he is fit enough to compete at the top level.
""If my body is in good shape and I'm still able to compete consistently, I'll keep playing,"" Murray said.
""But I can't look so far in advance with the age I'm at and with the issues I've had. If I was to have a big injury, I probably wouldn't try to come back from that.""
Murray played 45 singles matches in 2022, winning 26 and reaching finals in Stuttgart and Sydney to reach an end-of-year ranking of 49.
His best run in a Grand Slam was reaching the third round of the US Open, where he lost in four sets to Matteo Berrettini.

Murray will face Jack Draper on Wednesday and Dan Evans on Thursday, before teaming up with brother Jamie - who has arranged the event - to play Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski.
After that, the two-time Olympic gold medallist is targeting improved performances at the Grand Slams next year, starting at the Australian Open in January.
""I spent three weeks in Florida, getting my body right and getting some work done on my game and it went really well,"" he said.
""I'm certainly in better shape than I was. A lot of work was done in the gym, trying to build up my endurance and my stamina a bit and I'm hoping that's going to help me next year.
""I wasn't happy with how last season went - certainly the last six months or so from a physical perspective - but my ranking still went from 125 to 50 in a year. I'm hoping that this year, with the work I've done, things will continue to improve and I'll still be motivated to get out there and compete."""

sports	Non Evans: Sports star's struggles after career ends	"""And then you have a glass of wine and you think you feel better. And it took hold of me and nearly ruined my life.""
words of Non Evans, 10 years since retiring from elite level sport.
Having won 87 caps for the Wales women's rugby team, she also competed for her country at three different disciplines in the Commonwealth Games. 
So when everything came to an end with a hamstring injury, she found life difficult, and is now eager to speak out about her mental health. 
""I think I started struggling, feeling depression and anxiety when I finished my sport,"" she told the Bore Sul programme on BBC Radio Cymru.
""And I had to work on that and things did get better over the years.""
But with lockdown, she lost her job as a medical sales representative for Pfizer, with that, a company car, and things started to unravel for the 47-year-old who had always been obsessional about her job and sporting life.
She had a remarkable sporting career: in rugby, she scored 64 tries for Wales as a fullback-cum-winger who also kicked the winning penalty for a Wales women's team that beat England for the first time. 
She also has two silver Commonwealth Games judo medals to her name. As if that wasn't enough, she was an international in weightlifting and wrestling too.
""I started drinking and it was because of my anxiety,"" she said.
""I'd wake up in the morning feeling frightened, feeling scared. 
""I couldn't tell you what I was scared of. It was just a feeling I had inside. 
""And then you have a glass of wine and you think you feel better. 
""And it took hold of me and nearly ruined my life.""
former athlete feels those involved in sports, particularly women, are especially vulnerable.
""All those hours of your day that were filled with everything you loved is gone,"" she said.
""And it leaves you with this emptiness inside that you can't explain to anyone.""
She said her life was busy, but when she finally retired, she was left with nothing. 
""I didn't have children, didn't have family, didn't have a husband, because my life was dedicated to sports.""
And then she turned to alcohol.
""I was drinking to feel normal,"" she says.
""And that is the scariest thing I've ever been through in my life. 
""I've had many injuries in sport, I've had let-downs, I've had successes, but that was frightening. 
""I'd be feeling like I was shaking inside, and that is when your body becomes addicted to this awful poison which is alcohol. 
""I would then drink just to get my body to feel normal.
""And that's when I knew I needed help, and this had to stop because I was either going to end up dead or doing so many stupid things.""
During lockdown, she was given a nine-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, after admitting threatening behaviour during an altercation with the police at her home in Langland, Swansea.
She was also banned from driving after her car was involved in a crash with another vehicle in November 2019. 
Being a public figure, her story was all over the newspapers, filled online columns, and only made her attempts to get better even harder.
""The last time I was on the front page of the papers was perhaps for kicking the winning penalty to beat England. 
""The next thing, I got arrested, crashed my car and that's on the front page of the papers so I had to deal with issues I was suffering as well as being in the public eye.""
She had hit rock bottom and realised things had to change. 
She spent time in a specialist rehabilitation centre, and went to support groups. She received counselling, a process that helped her greatly, to step out of the darkness. 
But she admitted she has bridges to build with loved ones.
""I've upset a lot of people, people have forgiven me, but my family have found it difficult, especially my mum and dad. 
""I don't see them as often as I did because they've seen what I've done and heard things that upset them. But I hope that will get better over time.""
Non said she now felt better than ever, is preparing to write an honest autobiography, and as well as being a fitness mentor to her private clients, is excited to start a new job. She is also eager to help other people who have found lockdown difficult.
""When people come to me, I can talk to them, not just about getting fit and losing weight, but how they can come out the other side in terms of their mental health which has affected so many people young and old during this lockdown period and during Covid.""
re is also a massive void, in her opinion, when it comes to acknowledgment about the difficulties of retirement, especially for top level athletes.
""I'd love to set something up to help sports people to get ready for retirement and how do they deal with that. Yes it's tough and people out there are struggling and I can help them with what I've been through and how to deal with retirement from sports.""
After a few extremely difficult years, she said she had now come out the other side and is looking forward to a bright future. 
She has regrets, but hopes for forgiveness.
""I'm glad that people still come up to me on the street and say 'oh, you're Non Evans the rugby player'.
""They don't come up to you and say 'Non Evans... [who] got arrested and suffered with anxiety and depression'.
""They still see me as Non the rugby player, which I'm glad about and, yes, I've got bridges to build up again. 
""But I think I'm on my way and hopefully my story can help other people to see that there is light at the end of the tunnel."""

""Some of them have been there four or five years before they became regulars on the TV. I feel the first two years I've had have been a nice honeymoon, but I would like to give it another go.""
Mitchell, nicknamed Scotty Dog, had a breakthrough year in 2014 where he won a number of events organised by the now-defunct British Darts Association (BDO).
He won the BDO World Darts Championship in 2015 and ended the year ranked world number one, but he has been unable to hit the same form since joining the PDC Tour.
One of the biggest challenges he faces is juggling his job as a farmer with throwing and competing.
""It's difficult to compete with full time pro's when you're still working. It's not a five day a week job, we're farming 24/7.
""This [darts] is a glorified hobby for me. But maybe it's time I applied myself a little bit more, I don't know, but I have enjoyed every second of the tour and it's been a great two years of my life.""
Mitchell says it would be impossible to even consider a future as a darts player without his supportive family by his side: ""We do everything together and we're very much about having family discussions about the important things, and darts is one of them.
""I have options but I have to weigh up what's best for me and what's best for the farm. I'm not really that good at saying what's best but my family know me very well, and they know what suits me.
""Now that the BDO has gone the amateur side, away from the PDC, has come alive and there are varying organisations and tournaments I can play in.
""I do some commentary as well and there is also the World Seniors Tour, which I qualify for now.
""I still play for Dorset and my daughter plays in the women's team too and I absolutely love it. That's one thing that won't change, until they tell me that they don't want me anymore - we just have to sit down and discuss where my future plans lie."""
sports	Modern pentathlon obstacle course details announced	"A rope swing, monkey bars and a ""tsunami wall"" will be among the challenges facing athletes as part of changes to modern pentathlon.
Obstacle course racing is set to be part of a modern pentathlon competition for the first time next month at a test event in Ankara, Turkey.
Show jumping was removed by UIPM, the sport's international governing body, after the Tokyo Olympics.
However there have been protests at the decision.
Pentathlon United - a group against show jumping's removal - says the sport is in ""crisis"" and needs an independent investigation.
re were more than 60 proposals for the sport's new fifth discipline.
But UIPM said the obstacle course discipline was being included as it appealed to ""all age groups including youth"" and was ""dynamic and attractive to global audiences"".
It will replace the equestrian element in the Olympic modern pentathlon line-up from the 2028 Los Angeles Games if approved at November's UIPM Congress.
urkey will involve two to four athletes racing each other over a course up to 100 metres long with as many as 10 obstacles which could include:
""tsunami wall"" would be a climbed finish to the course. 
UIPM described the addition of the discipline as ""the biggest shake-up of the Olympic sport in its 110-year history"".
""Athletes have been invited to run, walk, climb, crawl, slither, scramble or otherwise propel themselves to the finish line of a bespoke course in Ankara next month,"" UIPM added.
Equestrian was dropped from the sport after German coach Kim Raisner struck a horse at last year's Tokyo Games when it refused to jump a fence, which led to widespread criticism."
sports	Commonwealth Games: NI trio miss out on judo bronze medals	"Northern Ireland suffered disappointment in their pursuit of more judo medals at the Commonwealth Games as three judokas lost bronze medal matches on Tuesday.
Eoin Fleming, Rachael Hawkes and Joshua Green were one win away from the podium but missed out at Coventry Arena.
NI were on the hunt for more medals after Yasmin Javadian and Nathon Burns won bronze a day earlier.
Sarah Hawkes is the final NI judoka to begin her campaign on Wednesday.
Fleming, who lost at the same stage in Glasgow eight years ago, lost in gut-wrenching fashion against Australia's Uros Nikolic.
NI fighter sustained a bad ankle injury and could barely stand let alone fight at the contest went to Golden Score, but after the bravest of efforts a tearful Fleming simply could not continue.
Green was beaten in his bid for a men's -73kg medal as impressive Australian Jake Bensted took his second Commonwealth gold in just one minute and 13 seconds.
It was similar disappointment for Hawkes who missed out in the women's -70kg against Katie-Jemima Yeats-Brown of England.
Earlier on Tuesday NI had maintained their strong showing in the judo as Fleming reached the semi-finals of his category.
Fleming advanced to the last four with two wins, firstly edging a hard-fought encounter with Odysseas Georgakis of Cyprus before securing a lightning-fast win by ippon over Nauru's Kip Kosam in the quarters, but was then beaten in the last four by impressive Canadian Francois Gauthier Drapeau
Fleming, 27, would agonisingly miss out in the bronze medal match for the second time, having suffered the same fate at Glasgow 2014, as he sought NI's third judo medal of the Birmingham Games after team-mates Yasmin Javadian and Nathon Burns both won bronze on Monday.
Hawkes lost her quarter-final to Jamaica's Ebony Drysdale Daley but received a bye in the repechage so advances directly to the medal contest.
Green claimed a dramatic Golden Soint repechage win over Sri Lankan Chamal Repiyallage after losing his quarter-final defeat by Cypriot Dato Matsoukatov, who was awarded the win by ippon.
Earlier he had dispatched of Trinidad and Tobago's Jelanie Boyce in just 34 seconds."

sports	LeBron James: NBA superstar's evolution from high school prodigy	"It was another unscripted moment of genius, another masterful flourish from a man approaching 20 years at the very top of his game. 
LeBron James picked up possession in the corner during a mid-January meeting with the Houston Rockets. He looked to shoot - a three-pointer. As he did so, his Los Angeles Lakers team-mate Dennis Schroder teased from the bench behind: ""Bet you won't make it."" 
""To make a bet official you gotta look a man in the eye,"" James later said. And that's exactly what he did; releasing the ball on its arc towards the net before quickly turning to face up the wager, his back to the court as the net rippled and bedlam broke loose. 
James, in his 18th NBA season, had turned 36 two weeks earlier. Yet he appears to be having more fun than ever, and is still inflicting misery on the rest of the league. 
Here, former coaches, team-mates and opponents chart the rise of this remarkable player; from teenage prodigy to fully fledged superstar and beyond. 
r analysis helps frame the ways in which this unique sportsperson has evolved through the years to remain not only relevant and successful but ahead of the pack.
In the summer of 2003, James was putting in extra work before his rookie season. Aged only 18, he had long been regarded as basketball's next great hope. 
He was the cover star of the prestigious Sports Illustrated magazine while still a junior in high school. For years it had been predicted he would be the number one pick in the 2003 NBA draft - and sure enough he was. Selected by his hometown team the Cleveland Cavaliers, rarely has a teenager carried such high expectations into their professional debut. 
roughout that summer, James travelled to the Cavaliers' practice facility - a 40-minute drive from where he grew up in Akron, Ohio - for intense one-to-one training with Bob Donewald Jnr, one of the team's assistant coaches.
After one session, coach and superstar-in-waiting chatted during a cool-down routine. ""I wasn't great today,"" James said. ""It wasn't a great workout.""
""You were alright. It's been a long week,"" replied Donewald, who had pushed the teenager hard across consecutive days of gruelling work in preparation for the 82-game season. ""LeBron, I just want you to be great. That's why I'm pushing you.""
""I am great,"" James responded, a flat, serious expression washing over his face. ""If you want me to be the greatest ever, I'm with that."" 
No-one was more aware of the future that had been written for him than James himself. No-one better appreciated the work required to fulfil that promise.
""Every cut, every shot, every move he made - you'd have thought it was a Game 7 finals, the intensity with which he went,"" Donewald remembers of those early one-to-one sessions. ""I'm trying to crush this kid in a workout just to teach him a lesson, and he is bringing it and bringing it.
""Everybody was hard on him too - the players, head coach Paul Silas. They were friendly, but they weren't going to hand it to this kid, and he didn't want it handed to him."" 
James also understood the highest echelons of superstardom are only attained when the pageantry of elite sport is embraced; that you create your own myth before selling it to the world.
At half-time in a pre-season intra-squad scrimmage, some of the Cleveland players decided to do battle in an impromptu slam dunk contest. James watched from the sidelines while established players entertained the crowd with an array of athletic jams. But those who'd stuffed the arena to capacity were really there to see one man.
""He looks at me and grins ear to ear,"" Donewald says of the moment James decided to take centre stage. ""He says, 'watch this'. I said, 'are you going to take over this place?' He said, 'I'm about to take over this place'.""
James proceeded to run through a sequence of stunning slam dunks. Showcasing his once-in-a-generation athleticism, he rose higher than any of his team-mates, his head above the rim as he stuffed the ball through the basket. He passed the ball between his legs and around his back as he ascended. The crowd had got what they came for.
""The place went wild,"" Donewald says. ""In the second half, he came out and just torched it. And from then on in practices, it was some next-level stuff.""
When it came time to dub the rookie with a nickname, the NBA's new showman chose appropriately. 
""I already have a nickname,"" James explained. ""The King."" 
""Young buck, I ain't calling you King,"" Donewald objected. ""I'm an Elvis Presley fan, and The King is Elvis Presley.""
""OK, then,"" James said. ""Call me Elvis.""
James' debut arrived on 29 October 2003. The Cavaliers travelled to face the Sacramento Kings for their season opener. Expectations were high, but the teenager still had more than his share of doubters. After all, he had skipped a step on the traditional route to the NBA, going professional straight out of high school - prep to pro - rather than using college basketball as a stepping stone. 
On the cross-country flight to California, coach Silas turned to Donewald and asked: ""This fella gonna deliver? He is a rookie.""
""Yeah,"" Donewald replied confidently. ""I think he is.""
""I think he will, too,"" Silas smiled.
Cleveland lost the game 106-92, The King outdone by the Kings, but James could hardly have impressed more in defeat. His 25 points set a record for a prep-to-pro player on debut, bettering the exalted company of Kevin Garnett, Tracy McGrady and Kobe Bryant.
""The expectations were just incredible,"" Donewald says. ""We weren't talking about 'he needs to be a good player'. We were talking about 'he needs to be one of the best rookies ever'. 
""Everywhere we went, there were crowds. Instead of going in the front door of the hotel, now we've got to go in the back door. Tickets are now hard to come by. Friends and cousins you haven't heard from in a while want to come to games. 
""It was nuts. It was everywhere we went, because of him, and he just handled it. Nothing ever fazed him in that way, which was just so strange to me. This was an 18-year-old kid. A kid who'd just got out of high school.""
James became the first player in Cavaliers history to be named NBA rookie of the year at the end of his maiden season. His per-game averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists were the bare stats of one of the all-time great debut campaigns. 
re was one area of criticism: his jump shot. 
In the final two seconds of his debut against the Kings, James launched a three-point attempt, the confidence of a sublime overall display coursing through him. But the ball sailed past the rim and the backboard, straight out of play. 
James finished his breakout 2003-04 season with just a 41.7% success rate on field goal attempts, an average which plummeted further to just 29% on shots from beyond the three-point arc. Both figures were short of the league-wide averages of 43.9% and 34.7% respectively.
Again, James got to work.
""Usually it's the coach having to teach the kid that, but not this one,"" says Donewald.
""He just wanted to work on it. Practice is at 10? Hey, let's meet at nine. Let's work. Let's work.
""Confidence in his shot was the biggest improvement. Not that he couldn't shoot - that was the biggest misconception. I thought he could shoot even then. It was just learning how to get into the shot and get his feet down. He had the jump shot, but he had to get the feet right. During the year, he developed that pretty quickly.""
following season, James shot 47% from the field and 35% from three-point range. His field goal accuracy never again dropped below 47% in the rest of his career, reaching the 50% mark in the 2009-10 campaign when he was crowned the league's Most Valuable Player.
By that stage, James had taken Cleveland to a NBA Finals (losing to the San Antonio Spurs in 2007), established himself as one of the league's most dominant scorers - averaging over 30 points per game in 2005-06 and 2007-08 - and its best all-round player. 
Without a championship, though, he could not claim to have delivered on his potential.
Donewald was on his way out of London's Olympic Stadium when he was tackled to the ground by ""what I thought was a bear"". 
As coach of the Chinese basketball team for the 2012 Games, he'd led a procession around the track for the opening ceremony. As his players made their exit through the tunnel, Team USA were about to enter.
""Elvis!"" Donewald shouted, recognising the six-foot-nine 'bear' that had wrestled him to the deck. 
""We did it! We did it!"" James was shouting.
A month earlier, James had claimed his first NBA title and was named Finals MVP as the Miami Heat overcame the Oklahoma City Thunder by four games to one. He'd also been named regular-season MVP for the third time. 
James' move to Miami in 2010 was tinged with controversy. Many fans and league insiders felt announcing which team he'd join in free agency via a live television special, entitled The Decision, was in bad taste. 
""I'm going to take my talents to South Beach,"" James said on the air, paraphrasing a teenage Kobe Bryant's announcement that he was skipping college to join the NBA in 1996. Cavaliers fans were crushed.
But James' decision - if not The Decision - was vindicated by his success in Florida, where he linked up with fellow perennial All-Stars Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh to create one of the most-feared 'super teams' the NBA has ever seen. 
Heat reached four straight Finals, winning twice - in 2012 and 2013 - and James took his MVP haul to four, just two shy of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record of six, and one behind Michael Jordan and Bill Russell.
James turned 28 midway through the Heat's 2012-13 championship-winning season. He was at his peak; the full realisation of his teenage promise.
Orlando Johnson was part of the Indiana Pacers team that faced James and the Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals that year. A rotation player in the same position, Johnson knew the task of stopping the unstoppable would fall to him in the minutes he saw.
""He sees the court like no other and he could do it all,"" Johnson says. ""He could hit the mid-range; that's when his three-ball was really starting to take off. Just how strong he was; I think he might have been a little bit bigger then - 270, 280 pounds maybe. His passing ability, and just his speed. His speed was off the charts. 
""Trying to keep this guy in front, it was like, man, this is a different beast. During that time especially, he might have been at peak athleticism.
""I think what I respected in him the most was the way he could lock in on a game when it's go-time. You hear about his Game 7 performances throughout his career. He doesn't really lose those games."" 
ries had been close, but the deciding game was a blowout. The Heat won by 13 points and James led all scorers with 32 while also contributing eight rebounds and a team-high four assists. They would face the Spurs in the Finals, and James would claim revenge for 2007's heartbreak thanks to a series-best 25.3 points per game in another 4-3 victory. 
""We saw the levels he could take it to,"" Johnson adds. ""At that time, I don't think any of us could reach it. When he locked in and took it to another level, it was different. 
""A guy like him, he's going to go down as one of the greatest to ever play the game.""
In 2014, James decided to reverse The Decision and take his talents back to Cleveland. In the Heat's fourth consecutive Finals appearance, just a few months before, they'd lost in five games to the Spurs. James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers as a free agent.
In the four years he'd been away, Cleveland had compiled the worst overall win-loss record (97-215) in the NBA. They finished 10th in the Eastern Conference for 2013-14.
In Miami, James was the centrepiece of a superstar ensemble. Continuing his quest for championships in Cleveland - who had no NBA titles to their name - would require an effort of leadership as much as skill. 
With gifted young point guard Kyrie Irving already on the roster and All-Star power forward Kevin Love acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves, James' Cavaliers were not without talent, but the group would need inspiration and winning nous.
""I think it's the balance of knowing how good you are and at the same time respecting your team-mates and knowing you need them to win,"" says Jose Calderon, who played for the Cavaliers during the 2017-18 season.
""Some guys forget about that. He doesn't. He's a great team-mate. He was amazing. He was the first one there, and he worked every day. There were no days off."" 
James led the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals in each of the four years of his second spell in Cleveland, taking his personal tally of consecutive Finals appearances to eight. Those around him noticed how he once again elevated his game during the playoffs, year after year.
""He was so ready for that,"" Calderon says. ""For some players, it's difficult to turn it on and off, but you could see he had one more level that was 1,000 times more of everything. More focused. More rest. More rehab. More of anything he needed to do to be ready.""
Had they not coincided with the Golden State Warriors team of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and, from 2016, Kevin Durant, the Cavaliers might have collected more championship rings. The one they did win, though, will be forever remembered among the greatest NBA upsets. 
railing the Warriors 3-1 for the 2016 title, Cleveland fought back to claim a miraculous 4-3 triumph - a comeback on that scale had never been pulled off before in Finals history. 
""Cleveland, this is for you!"" an emotional James screamed at the end of his post-game interview on the court. He had delivered the city's first professional sports title. All was forgiven for his years in Miami.
Alongside Irving's winning shot in Game 7, James' chase-down block on Andre Iguodala - sprinting to leap and swat away a lay-up attempt - was the iconic play of the series.
It is telling that a signature play in the career of one of basketball's greatest and most complete offensive talents is a hustle effort on defence to snuff out what seemed a certain score for the opposition.
""That just showed the commitment,"" says Neal Meyer, an NBA executive who served as a video co-ordinator for the Cavaliers in 2009-10. ""Giving a little bit extra effort to get there and make that block, which changed everything.""
Calderon says: ""When people ask me about LeBron, I always say: he's maybe not the best scorer; he's maybe not the best rebounder; he's maybe not the best with assists. But all around, I think he's the best player. He's the most complete player. 
""He can play defence. He can see the floor; he can see his team-mates. He knows what he wants in every moment of the game. I think that's what sets him apart. 
""They can't do what he can do on the court.""
When his contract in Cleveland expired, at the end of the 2017-18 season, James decided to move on once again, albeit this time in less controversial fashion. At the age of 33, he signed with the LA Lakers. 
One of the NBA's storied franchises, the Lakers boast some of the game's most illustrious names among their club legends and have won 17 championships - but they hadn't posted a winning record since the 2012-13 season.
Returning the Lakers to their former glories would be a difficult task even for James, but one that would cement his legacy if he achieved it.
""He was still a leader, incredibly team-oriented,"" says Clay Moser, a former assistant coach on the Lakers who'd previously worked with James at the Cavaliers in 2010. 
""Quite frankly, that's the way he's been since he was a young man, probably before he even hit double digits as a person. He's obviously ageing, but his skill-sets are all still incredible. He works like no other. He's an early riser, keeps himself in impeccable condition.
""He's all about winning. And he's all about working to make sure you're in a position to win.""
In 2018-19, a groin injury meant James played only 55 of the Lakers' 82 regular-season games, the most he'd had to sit out in his career. LA finished with a 37-45 record. James missed the playoffs for the first time since 2005.
""I remember the game he got hurt,"" Moser says. ""It was Christmas Day and we were at Golden State. I was close enough that I heard his groin pop a little bit, and he heard it too. He knew he was hurt bad. But, in classic fashion, he worked hard at his rehab, he worked hard at his therapy, and he came back as quickly as he could. Unfortunately for us, it was a little bit too late.""
Before the next season, 2019-20, the Lakers completed a crucial trade to acquire Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans. LA gave up three young talents and a handful of future draft picks to acquire one of the most talented forwards in the game. 
With an elite scorer now on his side, James adapted his game. While still averaging a healthy 25.3 points - rising to 27.6 in the playoffs - he became more of a facilitator, posting a league-high and career-best average of 10.2 assists per game. 
James withdrew into the backcourt, effectively acting as the Lakers' point guard for the majority of possessions. He would instigate moves from deep, spring fast breaks with arrow-like passes or draw the attention of defenders before offloading to an open team-mate.
""I think he probably could've led the league in assists any year he wanted to,"" Moser says. ""But when they got Davis and they retooled the team in the manner they did, I think he set his mind to the fact Davis is going to be the primary go-to guy. LeBron was going to make sure everybody got easy looks at the basket, and that's exactly what he did.""
Interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, 2019-20 ended with the final regular-season rounds and all of the playoffs taking place in a fan-less 'bubble' at Disney World, Florida. 
It also ended with the Lakers collecting their first championship in a decade. It was a fourth ring for James and a fourth Finals MVP crown.
Powered by James and Davis, the Lakers are favourites to repeat their 'bubble' success in 2021. James is now 36 but showing no signs of slowing. With the care he has paid to his physical shape and wellbeing throughout his career, and with Abdul-Jabbar's all-time NBA scoring record in his sights - 35,171 to the leader's 38,387 - he is as motivated as ever. 
""He's still one of the best players in the world,"" Moser says. 
""He doesn't have these ups and downs in terms of his conditioning. He's always in great shape. He's always ready to go. He's incredibly strong - like, incredibly strong. He's got north-south quickness. He's got great hand-eye coordination. All those sorts of things. 
""If he is declining, I'd hate to see guys that really are."" "

Heath won four Olympic sprint canoe medals from three Games, including K1 200m gold at Rio 2016.
37-year-old is also a two-time world and five-time European champion.
""I've done everything I set out to do and more,"" Heath told BBC Sport. ""I've gone way and above what I thought I could achieve in the sport.""
He added: ""I've ticked pretty much every box on the list that any athlete would want to tick.

Heath won his first Olympic medal on home waters at London 2012, winning K2 200m bronze alongside Jon Schofield.
Four years later in Rio the pair upgraded to silver, with Heath winning the individual event, and in Tokyo last year he won K1 bronze.
In 2017, he completed the canoe sprint grand slam of holding the Olympic, world and European titles.
""It has been a hard decision. There's obviously a bit of conflict because it's all you've known and done for such a long time,"" he said.
""It was a pretty tricky decision but I've always said it's a family decision, something I've made with not just me in mind, but my family, my wife and my two kids.

He keeps them all in pristine, boxed condition - a prerequisite for any self-regarding sneakerhead - and on racks he picked up from a closing Foot Locker store. It's a lifelong passion that has evolved into his livelihood, a business he has grown from a side hustle in his school days.
""When I was in college, my mother lost her job,"" Jones explains. ""I had a car and my mother was paying for it. She told me she could no longer pay, so I started flipping [my extra pairs] out of the trunk.
""I'd buy a pair of Air Jordan Concord 11s for $150 and sell them for $350. I sold enough to be able to get me through college and pay for the car. So I always knew there was something there.""
It's no coincidence that Jones was so drawn to these shoes, having grown up in 1980s Brooklyn. After all, it was this area of the five boroughs that benefited from some of the most important drivers of the sneaker culture we know today: hip hop, street basketball and Michael Jordan.
Arguably the greatest player to ever shoot hoop, Jordan was born in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, just a few miles from Jones' childhood home, although he moved to North Carolina at a young age.
Jordan's status in the eyes of 1980s USA was already rarefied thanks to his prowess on the court with the Chicago Bulls, but when almost exactly 35 years ago, on 15 September 1985, Nike released the Air Jordan 1s, it gave the fan on the street a tangible way to bring a little of his prestige to their own person.
For many, the Air Jordan 1s are the shoe that kickstarted the global sneaker resale market, an industry recently valued at $6bn (£4.6bn) by Cowen Equity Research and predicted to be worth $30bn (£23bn) by 2030.external-link It is a theory seemingly supported by the eye-watering figures this particular model of trainer has sold for at auctions in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Boosted by the release of the popular Last Dance Netflix series, which documents Jordan's exploits at the height of his aerial powers, both Sotheby's and Christie's have registered record prices at recent auctions.
A pair of game-worn Air Jordan 1s High, replete with an embedded shard of glass from a backboard shattered by a particularly powerful Jordan dunk, sold for a record $615,000 (£468,000) at Christies this August. That merely followed the previous high watermark set by a Sotheby's auction held in May, when another signed pair of Air Jordan 1s netted $560,000 £426,000).
Air Jordan 1s are of particular value. They were they designed by legendary sneaker designer Peter Moore. They reflected Jordan's specific request to feel 'closer to the court' by removing the air bubble from the sole. And they were also famously banned by the NBA within a month of release.
riety among fans that quickly turned the sneaker into a sales phenomenon. Nike, ever attuned to a marketing opportunity, exploited the situation with a widely broadcast advertexternal-link that boasted: ""Fortunately, the NBA can't stop you from wearing them.""
Demand was so high that Jordan sneaker muggings and attacks became commonplace in many American cities. A killing over the trainer promoted Sports Illustratedexternal-link to run with a cover story title: ""Your Sneakers or Your Life.""
Jones himself experienced the violent side associated with demand for sneakers when in 2012 - at a New York release of the Nike Kobe 7 models - he was stabbedexternal-link while camping overnight outside the store in a queue. It's an incident he chooses to no longer revisit in interviews.
Air Jordan 1s' release was a seminal moment according to Simon 'Woody' Wood, founder of global trainer magazine Sneaker Freaker,external-link and not just because of the cultural hype.
""One of the beautiful things about the shoe is the quality of the leather,"" he says. ""I have a pair of Jordans here from 1985. The leather is thick as anything. It feels like they just sliced a chunk of cow off and stitched it to the shoe. They're pretty much indestructible."" 
Woody, based in the Australian city of Melbourne, is something of an expert on the subject. Having started the Sneaker Freaker magazine as a cult read and vehicle to get free sneakers from manufacturers in 2002, Woody's business has since ballooned into a website, a merch business, a creative agency and a magazine that's now sold in 40 countries. Most recently he authored a 700-page book called The Ultimate Sneaker; to which nearly forty pages were devoted to Jordans alone.
""I mean really I could've filled the entire book on Jordans,"" he says. ""In terms of investment that might've been a smarter move right now! It's the only brand really based on an athlete. And, he's the Supreme Being, a god around which a whole mystique has been built.
""The Americans love him as a winner, a guy who comes from nowhere and becomes the most famous and wealthy person ever. But physically to watch him jump from, you know, beyond the three point line and sink a basket, he was just so good. And the shoes really locked into that aspect of him.""
rightness of the star factor associated with the Air Jordan 1s has been key in helping them remain, in a galaxy of standout sneakers, the most coveted for those with money to spend. Especially for ""cashed up guys in their 40s and 50s"" who remember Jordan at his height, Woody believes.
Another secret behind the mystique, he suggests, lies in the enduring appeal of their design features. There's the 'wings logo' - inspired by airline badges of the time - the red, white and black colours that echoed Jordan's Chicago Bulls affinity, and 'classic panelling' that help to build the sneaker's 'story'. A story that was given a new chapter in April this year when Dior teamed up with Nike to release a new, co-branded version of the model that retailed for $2,000 (£1,520) a pair.
Featured on the cover of Sneaker Freaker, the shoe quickly sold out when a staggering five million people tried to buy the 8,500 pairs released. Online marketplace StockX shows the shoe drawing anything up to $20,000 on its real time price graphs that one would associate more readily with trading stocks.
Covid-related economic volatility, it seems, is not a problem in the sneaker resale niche, where profits are not only increasing but markets are expanding.
For Jones, his day to day may now be in Fort Lee, New Jersey - where his white-soled sneakers benefit from sidewalks that are ""thankfully cleaner than in New York"" - but his future profits will increasingly be drawn globally.
Local knowledge used to be key in sourcing sneaker gems, as boutique stores and little-known outlets across New York City would sell their limited supplies to in-the-know hunters. Though he still refers to his hometown as the ""world Mecca for sneakers"", the bulk of Jones' purchases are made online via a network of other collectors, with sales increasing in hotspots like Asia. It has helped him amass over 1,100 pairs in total, and some of his favourites are in the black sports bag on the floor below.
""This is a PlayStation Air Force 1 anniversary shoe, only 50 pairs in the world. Made in 2009 by Nike and worth around $10,000,"" he says, matter of factly. ""These are Stash Zoom Kobe 1s, made in collaboration with NORT in 2006, They're worth about $20,000.""
Designs associated with players like the tragic figure of Kobe Bryant help to drive prices higher, but ultimately it's the discerning eye of the collector that sets the value: beauty being firmly in the eye of the buyer.
It was an appreciation Jones' wife, Adena, struggled to come to terms with when the couple first started dating. Admitting to suffering vertigo from sleeping under the great walls of boxed shoes that lined his apartment, she came to understand their value when her then boyfriend linked his Paypal account to hers. It allowed him to showcase the sale returns of his accumulating assets in real time.
""I quickly realised their power. I saw $8,000 come in from two pairs and I was like: you're right, this is it! I tell people part of our home is paid for by sneakers. This ring, my wedding ring, is paid for by sneakers,"" she says, proudly holding forth her sparkling rock.
As co-founder of Another Lane, a new online business run in partnership with Jones that targets aficionados priced out by the recent sneaker boom, Adena is now convinced of what her husband has known since childhood: sneakers are more than just shoes, they are prized symbols of identity. In fact, Jones goes as far to suggest they have political symbolism too.
""Sneakers were originally white because that was the colour of the tennis-playing elites,"" he says.
""People who look like me traditionally served those people, that's why wearing the colour white is so significant in the black community. Wearing clean, white sneakers means you can afford them and you've elevated yourself in society.""
It's a sentiment echoed by Elizabeth Semmelhack, senior curator of Toronto's Bata Shoe Museumexternal-link and author of Out Of The Box: The Rise Of Sneaker Culture.
""Having enough money to step out in a 'fresh', pristine and unscuffed, pair of Nikes became a point of pride, a symbol of rugged individualism whose fashion was hyper-masculine and easily marketed in ways that capitalised on both its American-ness and its exoticism simultaneously,"" Semmelhack says.
""Can sneakers be used in a political way? 100% yes. It's why stepping on someone's prize pair can be deeply offensive.""
Semmelhack sees a through line from the nouveau riche, tennis-court origins of the mid-19th Century sneaker to rapper Jay-Z's affirmation that he would only ever wear a pair of white trainers once to maintain his crisp aesthetic. It's a notion Jones intrinsically understands.
""It's like, yo, that kid, he always got a fresh pair of sneakers on, I wonder what he does? It's like there's this mysteriousness, a question mark: what is this guy really about?"" he says.
rty-five years on, it seems hang time footwear has lost none of its potency."
sports	Winter Olympics: Why coming out was the start point for Mouat's Olympic double gold bid	"Bruce Mouat says telling his team-mates he is gay ""was possibly the best thing I ever did for my career"".
Scot has led his curling rink on an upward curve in the past few years, to the point they head into the Winter Olympics as the world's number one ranked side.
Mouat and mixed doubles partner Jen Dodds could become the first British athletes to win two golds at the same Winter Olympics, too, as they head to Beijing as world champions alongside their commitments in the men's and women's events.
Mouat's rise is down to many things - skill, determination, and composure are just a few. But he's clear that being true to himself has also been a big factor.
""It was something I was scared to do at the time,"" the 27-year-old says. ""I had been playing in juniors for a couple of years and I wasn't really getting the success I was looking for. 
""I always felt that we were good enough and the only thing that I could really put my thumb on was me not being truthful to who I was with the guys I was playing with. 
""We were obviously all teenagers - they all wanted to talk about girls and I just wasn't able to participate in that conversation. And I'd always kind of hid away and shied away from that.
""But after seeing how people could live their life as a gay person it encouraged me to do it because you were seeing so many people having success and still being happy. It was a very freeing experience for me.""
Having already come out to friends and family, telling his team-mates was the final hurdle, and he credits the wider curling community for their support.
His advice to others who might be struggling to be themselves openly is to lean on those close to them.
""I've never actually thought of myself as a role model for doing it,"" Mouat says. ""It was just what I wanted and needed to do to get the best success possible. Obviously I would support anybody who wants to do something similar to what I did.
""If anybody ever needs help with it, find the few people you are closest with and make sure you have that security blanket. If anybody ever does have a bad reaction please make sure you have those core people you can go to and speak to and feel happy about who you are.""
Mouat and his team - Grant Hardie, Bobby Lammie and Hammy McMillan - were in blistering form throughout 2021, winning two of the sport's prestigious grand slams and finishing as runners-up in the World Championships in a Tour bubble in Calgary.
r by storming to their second European title in preparation for Beijing. As skip, Mouat's calm demeanour has been a key part of the team's efforts and he has been marked out as one of the world's best players.
""I guess in curling terms, I have a bit of a poker face,"" Mouat laughs. ""I don't try and give much away. I try to appear calm but on the inside it is definitely not calm. 
""It is a lot of nerves and I like to listen to music and stuff to kind of calm myself before the event. But yeah, on the ice, I find myself in a different zone.""
A tough competitor, Mouat was a keen swimmer at school and was eventually forced to choose between that and curling after his teacher complained he was falling asleep in class while fitting both in either side of school.
Mouat hails from Edinburgh, and started at Gogar Park Curling Club in the city when his dad spotted a newspaper advert from the club looking for junior members.
""A year after we had started, the Winter Olympics of 2002 were on, which obviously was a great success for Rhona Martin and her team [winning gold],"" Mouat says. ""So it was quite easy to get into the sport after seeing that.""
It was at the same club that Mouat met Dodds, now his playing partner in the mixed doubles. The pair have been friends since they were six years old, and won the world title together in Aberdeen last year.
""She's a very energetic and fun person to be around and the relationship we've built over the last three or four years [playing] now it's something we enjoy,"" he says.
""Doing well would be very special and would mean a lot to our club back home as well. Everyone at Edinburgh curling has been so great to us and supported us throughout our careers way before we became potential Olympians.
""Hopefully it'll motivate people to take up the sport. That would be something to cherish for a long time.""
So could Mouat complete a historic double in Beijing and take both the men's and mixed doubles titles?
""I would accept one medal to be honest. Just to be there is quite special in itself. I'm realistic in my own expectations - hopefully in both. But if I'm doing it in one event then I'll be extremely happy."""
sports	Ryan Russell on Carl Nassib, the Super Bowl, and LGBTQ+ acceptance in American football	"There are some things Ryan Russell isn't sure about - such as who he wants to win the Super Bowl this Sunday.
And then there are the things about which the former NFL defensive end is certain - such as a belief that American football can thrive by becoming a more inclusive sport.
In the 12 months since the last Super Bowl, there has been a major breakthrough on that front, with Carl Nassib making history as the first NFL player to come out as gay and then feature in a regular-season game.
So as the Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals prepare to face each other in this year's showpiece, Russell has had chance to reflect on the recent changes he's seen regarding LGBTQ+ inclusion in this most American of sports. 
And to mark LGBT+ History Month, Russell - who came out as bisexual in 2019 - has been talking to the BBC about the sport he loves, the pride it has given him, and the ways it can become better at welcoming everyone.
But the Los Angeles-based ex-pro has also been looking forward to this weekend's big game at the cavernous SoFi Stadium.
""It's in LA, so of course we're going,"" Russell laughs.
""I've had friends who've played for both teams, so I'm a little torn on who I want to win. But for me, the Super Bowl is the embodiment of family, love, and a little friendly smack talk, and I love that.""
On the surface, Russell had it all as an NFL player, having achieved an American sporting dream.
His story began in Texas, where he grew up in a community built around the three 'Fs' of family, faith and football. 
After earning a full scholarship to Purdue University, he was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in 2015, starting a professional run that took him on to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and allowed him to test himself against some of the greatest in the game.
""You're constantly proving yourself, so when I think of moments in my career, they leave me choked up,"" Russell says. 
""I played Tom Brady on Thursday Night Football and got a couple of hits in on him. I got a sack in on Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, Eli Manning before he retired. You know, all these great games with guys that you watched and idolised, who are the reason that you play football."" 
It was only when a shoulder injury struck in the 2017-18 season that he realised something in his life needed to change. 
""I was forced to take a step back from football, and I realised that I wasn't attending to myself, my mental wellness, my own passions and desires outside of the sport,"" Russell remembers. 
""I had to ask myself who I was, and coming out was the most crucial part of me loving myself.""
In August 2019, Russell sat down with American sports network ESPN, and became the first active NFL player to open up about their bisexuality.external-link
""I definitely wouldn't say it was easy,"" he says. 
""Even when the cameras are on and I'm saying I'm bisexual... I can only think of a handful of times I'd said that to someone, let alone on camera. But it really was that first, full step I needed to take to be fully present in this life."" 
reaction to Russell's story was overwhelmingly positive, even though a small number of voices questioned the impact of having a gay or bisexual man in the locker room.
""I mean, it was like the same thing we heard years and years ago when we were told we can't have black and white players on the same team,"" Russell says.
""At one point, we were told women couldn't play sport. You know, people are always telling us what we can't do, especially when the 'us' is people who aren't of a certain community or race or gender.
""The United States has a history of policing people who they consider 'other', but I think we've got to a place where we can break that. 
""And I think male professional sport is on that fringe as well, to break that stereotype that we can't have gay or bisexual players.""
wo summers after Russell shared his story, Nassib spoke out about his truth.
In a handheld video posted on Instagram, the Las Vegas Raiders defensive end came out as gay, in what many saw as a watershed moment for the sport.
""I loved it,"" Russell says.
""I've had the pleasure of getting to know him as a friend and as a colleague, and it was so genuine and so him. It was just a nonchalant thing that he said, but it created so much love and opportunity and space for people.
""Carl has inspired so many, inside and outside of the sport, and I think it's a beautiful thing.""
Russell has no doubt that the sport he loves is moving in the right direction when it comes to inclusion and acceptance for the LGBTQ+ community.
It's been driven, in no small part, by the decision of players such as him and Nassib to open up, along with Michael Sam,Ryan O'Callaghanexternal-link and others who have shared their story. 
""This sounds crazy, but people didn't even know 'bisexual' as an identity when I was playing sports,"" Russell says.
""Like, it wasn't even a thing. So at least people know it exists now!""
But the ex-Cowboys player admits there's plenty more for the game to do in order to be a place where everyone feels welcome. 
""I think it's about visibility; about hiring LGBTQ+ players and coaches; about showing up for Pride Month, and doing it every year,"" he says.
""It's about knowing you might have a lot of diverse and beautiful identities in a locker room from different walks of life that you may not know or understand, but that you need to champion all of these players if you take on the position of head coach or GM [general manager].
""It's about speaking up and being visible, and not just doing that behind the scenes, even though that is great.
""You know, sometimes football can play the fence to not offend and keep the fanbase happy, but if you lose fans because you choose the side of love and equality and inclusion, do you really want those fans?
""Do you really want anyone who has something negative to say about love? I don't think so. I don't think that's what the NFL stands for.
""So, there's a lot to be done - but there are so many great and creative people in the NFL offices, I think they can come up with a good list of things to do.""

sports	Heineken Champions Cup: Five things we learned from opening weekend	"Twelve games played, 599 points scored and three new teams all made for a compelling start to the 2022-23 Heineken Champions Cup.
Eight sides from England, eight from France, three from Ireland and one each from Scotland and Wales were joined by three newcomers from South Africa in a new-look premier club competition - so what are the key talking points from the opening weekend?
BBC Sport takes a look at five things we learned.
re was a lot of noise around Leicester Tigers boss Steve Borthwick this weekend as he is among the favourites to replace Eddie Jones as the England head coach.
But the former lock was quick to shut down any suggestion of such a move in his pre-match news conference on Friday, and that message was conveyed to his players against Ospreys.
Anthony Watson's stunning solo try saw Leicester come from behind to earn a 23-17 win against Ospreys in Swansea.
Nicky Smith's try had given the hosts the lead before Harry Potter and Watson handed Tigers victory, despite Morgan Morris' late consolation try. The result means the two-year wait for a Welsh win in Europe's top tier competition goes on.
Speaking after the game, Borthwick said he was ""fully focused"" on facing Clermont next week - it remains to be seen whether he will still be in charge by then?
Arguably the headline of this year's tournament is the introduction of South African teams the Sharks, Stormers and Bulls.
Cell C Sharks were the first to make their bow in the formerly all-European competition with a 39-31 bonus-point win over Premiership side Harlequins in Durban.
Josh Bassett's second try got Quins to within one point of victory with five minutes remaining but Boeta Chamberlain scored to seal the win and take a losing bonus point away from the visitors, after earlier tries for the hosts from Bongi Mbonambi, Werner Kok and two from Makazole Mapimpi.
Andre Esterhuizen - a former Sharks player - scored two tries for Quins but that was only enough to secure a four-try bonus point.
Stormers lost 24-14 at French side and three-time runners-up Clermont Auvergne, while the Bulls beat Lyon 42-36 in Pretoria.
ree-time winners Saracens, who made their return to the competition after a two-season hiatus, had to come from behind to earn a 30-26 bonus point win over Edinburgh on Sunday.
Premiership leaders, who have won their opening nine league games of the season, went behind early on as their Scottish visitors played with intent.
Edinburgh scored the opening try through Luan de Bruin, before Elliot Daly crossed for the hosts. Ben Earl, Alex Lewington and Tom Woolstencroft all crossed to secure the bonus point for the hosts at the StoneX Stadium, while Wes Goosen's late try earned a losing bonus for Edinburgh. 
Sale Sharks continued their momentum after three league wins with a comfortable win over Ulster in the early game on Sunday, scoring six tries to claim a 39-0 bonus-point win at the AJ Bell Stadium.
Ulster's preparation for the game was disrupted by the cold weather in the north west of England, which meant they had to travel on the morning of the game after their flight on Saturday was cancelled.
Perhaps the visitors were sluggish from their disrupted schedule, but tries from Tom Curry, Dan du Preez, Rob du Preez, Tom Curtis, Byron McGuigan and Arron Reed led to a comfortable home win.
Holders La Rochelle began the defence of their crown with a thumping 46-12 bonus-point win over Northampton Saints.
French side have been in indifferent form with three defeats in their past five matches but they took control against Saints as first-half tries by Brice Dulin, Pierre Bourgarit, Pierre Boudehent and Dillyn Leyds wrapped up the bonus.
Gregory Alldritt charged down a clearance to score a fifth try before Ulupano Seuteni added a sixth.
re was some positivity for Saints, who welcomed back England forward Courtney Lawes for the first time in two months off the bench, before James Ramm and Matt Proctor scored consolation tries.
Next up for the holders is a trip to Ulster.
Injury to Leinster's Johnny Sexton prevented the latest instalment in the battle of the 10s between the Irishman and Scotland's Finn Russell.
Ross Byrne stepped in to replace Sexton at fly-half for the four-time winners as they dominated three-time runners-up Racing 92 to secure a 42-10 bonus-point away win.
Josh van der Flier was named men's player of the year at the World Rugby Awards last month, and his year just keeps getting better as he scored two tries in France, while Andrew Porter, Dan Sheehan, Garry Ringrose and Ed Byrne also crossed for the visitors.
Russell was limited to just five points from the boot, including a conversion for Christian Wade's try, as the disciplined Leinster defence prevented him from pulling the strings in midfield."
sports	Winter Olympics: Who is Kamila Valieva's coach Eteri Tutberidze?	"What kind of training method is it when a coach confronts rather than comforts a sobbing 15-year-old at the Olympic Games? 
""Chilling"", according to the International Olympic Committee. ""Key"" for athletes to achieve victory, according to the Russian government.
Eteri Tutberidze kind, according to what millions witnessed this week. 
urrounding her young skater Kamila Valieva at these Beijing Winter Olympics have thrust the spotlight on a coach who has produced a string of young champions in recent years.
So what do we know about the Russian and her methods? And will anything now change? 
utberidze, 47, is a former ice dancer who then lived in the United States in the 1990s for six years working in ice shows. 
While there she was caught up in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people. She and her troupe had been staying over the road from the federal building where the blast happened and received compensation as a victim of the attack.
While in the US, she had a daughter, Diana Davis, who competed at Beijing 2022 in the ice dance, finishing 14th along with Gleg Smolkin. Davis is not trained by her mother.
utberidze began building a coaching career in the US but then moved back to Russia, eventually joining the Sambo-70 club in Moscow. It was only eight years ago, when she coached 15-year-old Yulia Lipnitskaya to team gold with Russia at Sochi 2014, that she started to become a household name.
She has since won many coaching awards, including the International Skating Union's (ISU) coach of the year accolade in 2020 and a state award in 2018 that was presented to her by Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
ISU at the time described her as a ""talented coach"", who has ""given so much strength and dedication to her athletes this season"".
What sets Tutberidze's skaters apart from others on the world stage is their age and athleticism.
Lipnitskaya's 2014 Olympic success was followed in 2018 by Alina Zagitova, who was 15 when she won gold, ahead of 18-year-old silver medallist Evgenia Medvedeva. 
Pre-Beijing, everything was pointing to a clean sweep by Russian teenagers of the podium places. They had done just that at the European championships in January with Valieva finishing ahead of Anna Shcherbakova and Alexandra Trusova.
Instead it was 17-year-olds Shcherbakova and Trusova who took the gold and silver here, with Valieva finishing fourth after an error-strewn performance in Thursday's free skate following an incredibly difficult 10 days in which she had been allowed by a court to continue competing despite the revelation she had failed a drugs test.
rio are known as the 'quad squad' because they all perform quadruple jumps, which are the hardest and very rare in women's figure skating. They were the only ones of the 25 skaters competing in the individual event to attempt any.
But it is not only their young age when they win that is notable under Tutberidze. They are also often still teenagers when they retire.
Her athletes have a reputation in skating circles of being ""disposable"" - that is the word Austrian 1972 figure skating champion Beatrix Shuba once used - and part of a production line.
It is not really a surprise that they do not last long - by their nature, those high-scoring quads - rotating four times mid-air - are much easier to do when you have a small body with narrow hips and shoulders. 
""It is the little girl bodies that allow that type of rotation to happen, it is the same thing in gymnastics,"" said 1980 figure skating champion and BBC commentator Robin Cousins.
""With the men, 30 year olds can do them [quads], the male physiology seems to be different and allows for the longevity that the female body doesn't.""
If Valieva's failed drugs test results in a ban, she may well be hanging up her skates early, while Trusova said she was considering her future after an angry outburst over missing out on gold where she said ""I hate this sport, I hate all of it"".  
In an interview Tutberidze gave to Russia's Channel One in 2018, she said she makes champions through ""love"" not ""strictness"".
She also said that she ""doesn't demand things"" but wants to make athletes ""feel unsatisfied with their failure to complete a task"" so that ""they feel disgust inside them"".
Medvedeva said last year that Tutberidze's methods ""work but as you get older, with every year it's harder to put up with it"" and that she was also ""half-starving"" at times.
When Lipnitskaya retired at 17, she started treatment for anorexia, while Medvedeva, who has said she needed the ""toughness"" of Tutberidze's coaching style in order to succeed, has permanently damaged her back.
IOC president Thomas Bach said it ""does not give me much confidence"" in Valieva's entourage after seeing how she was offered no comfort when she stepped off the ice sobbing on Thursday - with Tutberidze instead asking her ""why did you stop fighting?"". 
""When I saw how she was received by her closest entourage with what appeared to be a tremendous coldness, it was chilling to see this, rather than giving her comfort, rather than to try to help her,"" said Bach.
In response to Bach, the deputy prime minister of Russia, Dmitry Chernyshenko, said: ""We are deeply disappointed to see an IOC president weave his own fictional narrative on the feelings of our athletes, and then present these publicly as the voice of the IOC.
""This is frankly inappropriate and wrong. Win or lose we know our athletes are world-beating, and they do too.""
Valiera's entourage is also under scrutiny in relation to the anti-doping investigation. The World Anti-Doping Agency says it will be launching an investigation into coaches, doctors and any other adults surrounding her.
ms likely to include coaches Sergei Dudakov and Daniil Gleikhengauz, who have been in Beijing, and also team doctor Filipp Shvetsky.
Valieva case has left many now questioning whether it is time to raise the minimum age of seniors in the sport from 15 - both in terms of protecting the children but also in terms of making it a level playing field regarding the jumps they can do.
gers have now won the women's singles gold medal in seven of the past eight Olympics.
""I absolutely believe that there should be an age limit,"" American skater Mariah Bell said this week. ""I know for me, personally, I know when you're growing there's a lot of changes happening. There are minors competing... that's a whole different thing.""
Her coach Adam Rippon added: ""If there are two people who are competing against each other, like a woman that gets a period and has breasts and has hips against a young little girl who is 80 pounds, is it a fair playing field?""
Age limits are determined by sports' individual federations, rather than the IOC, so it would be up to the International Skating Union.
Could it even be the quadruple jump that might need thinking about - what will the coaching methods be if older skaters are trying to achieve a young skater's jump?"
sports	Britain's Phoebe Paterson Pine on struggling to deal with Paralympic gold success	"After winning archery gold at last year's rescheduled Tokyo Paralympics, Britain's Phoebe Paterson Pine knew she should probably have been on top of the world.
On her Games debut, aged 23, the Cirencester archer triumphed in the women's compound event - a sweet success after a lifetime blighted by name calling and struggles with her disability.
But the post-Games blues cast a shadow over the Briton who tried archery for the first time aged 12 on a family holiday.
""I struggled really quite bad mentally when I got back from Japan. I just didn't know who I was and what I was doing,"" she tells BBC Sport.
""People thought what I had done was amazing and I must be on cloud nine. But I just had days when I didn't want to get out of bed because I just thought what was the point? 
""It was almost like I was having an existential crisis. 
""Going to a Paralympics, you get lots of advice and workshops on things like anti-doping and media training. There isn't any guidance for what happens when you win a gold medal - and it's different for everyone.""
Paterson Pine took a break for a month, spending time with family and her boyfriend and indulging in another passion - knitting - but for someone who knows that shooting arrows has a positive effect on her wellbeing, it was difficult.
""I'm definitely doing better now than I was before,"" she says ahead of her return to competition at this week's World Archery Para Championships (19-27 February) in Dubai, where she aims to add a world title to her memorable Paralympic gold.
""I've started taking anti-depressants, which are really helping to mellow out the ups and downs a bit more. 
""I'm also working with a new coach [former world medallist Andrea Gales] who is very experienced and knowledgeable and so supportive. Working with her has completely changed my mindset, so I feel happier in myself.
""I also feel like I've made the right choice when I comes to starting my medication, because it's something I need to do and I'm glad I have done, because it's such a taboo topic.""
Paterson Pine's Tokyo gold was achieved the hard way. She missed the 2018 season because of a bone infection in her heel and struggled on her return in 2019 when the initial Paralympic qualification slots were secured.
After the coronavirus pandemic delayed the Games by a year, it gave her a fresh focus and she dealt with her mental health issues to secure a quota spot for Great Britain at the final qualification tournament in July, before then having to wait to see if the place was hers.
In Japan, she faced the challenge of four elimination matches in one morning in a sport where the smallest of margins can make a huge difference, going up against - and beating - GB team-mate Jess Stretton on her way to winning Paralympics GB's only gold in the sport at the Games.
Growing up with spina bifida which left her unable to run, school PE lessons were a particular challenge, coupled with frequent verbal abuse about her condition.
""I was always the last person to be picked on teams and if I didn't get picked I sat out. I hated it,"" she recalls. 
""I knew that people were going to say things about the fact that I couldn't run and someone else was going to have to run more to make up for that. Then I felt bad for those around me and that was wrong. 
""I have so many bad memories that I never thought I would ever take part in and enjoy sport.
""So to have found archery and gone to Tokyo and been successful, and also be awarded an MBE, proves that everyone who has ever said anything mean about my disability is just wrong. Look at what I have achieved - disability or no disability.
""I did an interview after Tokyo where I got very emotional over the fact that I have been called so many horrible names throughout my life.
""But of all the things I have ever been called, Paralympic champion is the best."""
sports	Caitlyn Jenner to run W Series team in 2022	"Former Olympic champion Caitlyn Jenner will lead a new team, Jenner Racing, in this season's W Series.
-female competition, won last year by Britain's Jamie Chadwick, is set to support eight Formula 1 races in 2022, and former sportscar driver Jenner will run one of the teams. 
It is not yet known which two drivers will compete for Jenner's team.
""Motorsports is a place you can have diversity - whether trans or not it doesn't make any difference,"" she said. 
Jenner - one of the most high-profile trans women in the world - has previously said she was opposed to trans women participating in women's sport.
In an interview with BBC Sport, Jenner added: ""We need [a woman in Formula 1], we need diversity. We've had some [in] IndyCars. We had Danica Patrick in Nascar, but we want to move women into Formula 1 and I think [that] can happen.""
Jenner, who won decathlon gold at the 1976 Olympics before transitioning and featured in the reality television show Keeping Up With the Kardashians with former wife Kris, came out as a trans woman in 2015.  
""I was waiting for the opportunity to get involved with something in women's sports and keeping equality and diversity in women's sports,"" she said. 
""I've been watching the W Series and I have been so impressed, so we just signed the deal. Next year on the W Series we'll have a two-car effort for Jenner Racing. I couldn't be more excited. I'm back in racing!""
After retiring from athletics, Jenner had a successful career in the IMSA Sportscar Championship - the North American version of the World Endurance Championship, which includes the Le Mans 24 Hours race.
She competed for Ford, winning the 12 Hours of Sebring 1986 and coming second at the Daytona 24 Hours. 
re remains division on the debate around transgender participation in women's sport. 
A new framework on transgender inclusion from the International Olympic Committee, which says it should not be assumed that a transgender athlete automatically has an unfair advantage in female events, has been criticised by a group of medical experts as being too weighted towards a human rights perspective.
Last year, a wide-ranging review of transgender inclusion in non-elite sport in the UK said for many sports, ""the inclusion of transgender people, fairness and safety cannot co-exist in a single competitive model"".
report recommended that individual sports at grassroots level come up with their own priorities of inclusion or ""competitive fairness"" and safety - and decide whether additional ""open"" or ""universal"" categories may be needed.
But Jenner says motorsport is a level playing field for all - including the trans community.
""We have LGBT girls that are racing right now - we have no restrictions on transgender issues. 
""In motor racing it's a totally different deal. We want diversity and this would provide an opportunity for them.""
British transgender racing driver Charlie Martin has competed in a number of racing series across 2021, achieving podiums in every one. 
She said: ""Having someone like Caitlyn Jenner come into motorsport can only be a positive thing. 
""We need positive stories in the trans community - stories that drive hope, inspire change and improve representation. 
""Also Caitlyn Jenner understands motorsport - she knows what it takes to be successful, she knows what it takes to win.""
Martin added: ""It'd be amazing if she had a trans driver in the team - to see a trans driver competing in a series going out across the world. It'll be a very positive story; it'll give hope to a lot of people.
""It's hard enough to trying to make it in motorsport for any driver. 
""It's a real baptism of fire - I gave up on the sport at one point, because when I transitioned I couldn't see how I would ever be accepted back in the paddock.
""When I looked up when I was a kid and there was no-one like me, I know the impact that would have made to me to see a transgender driver competing at Le Mans."""

Kennedy beat compatriot Sarah-Jane Perry 11-6 8-11 11-5 14-12 in their semi-final and faces Canada's Hollie Naughton in the final on Wednesday.
""It's the best feeling I've had, ever,"" said an emotional Kennedy.
""Sport is all about role models, SJ's sportsmanship and her graciousness are amazing and everyone is inspired by her on court and off it.
""I just did not want it to go to a fifth game because her mental strength is her biggest asset. I think that if it had gone to a fifth I really would have struggled.""
Makin said: ""I knew he was hurting physically, but he actually came on stronger in the third game than he did in the first.

Italian broke two fingers on the way to second place in Friday's downhill and travelled to Milan for an operation. 
She returned to Switzerland for Saturday's race and competed with her left hand taped to her ski pole.
""Yesterday it was broken, today it was already fixed,"" said the 30-year-old.
""I'm really happy today and I'm really grateful because it was not guaranteed at all that I could be at the start gate today.
""I have to say huge thanks to the people who helped me out here yesterday, from the doctor to the driver who brought me."" 
Goggia, the 2018 Olympic champion, raced with a plate and nine screws inserted in the left hand and also had holes cut into her glove as she claimed her 11th victory in the past 16 World Cup downhill races she has competed in and her 20th overall.
Her time of one minute 28.85 seconds saw her finish 0.43secs ahead of Slovenia's Ilka Stuhec with Germany's Kira Weidle a further 0.09secs back.
""I couldn't push at the start gate and this is why I didn't have the gap of the training runs, but half a second is enough,"" she said of the victory margin. ""Also one hundredth of a second is enough.""
Goggia's aggressive style has led to a string of injuries. In 2021, she missed the World Championships in Cortina d'Ampezzo because of a right knee injury and earlier this year she won an Olympic downhill silver medal with a sprained knee.
""I really understand that it was a bit risky,"" she added. ""But I said to myself that after Beijing, I could endure everything and this is exactly what I did."""
sports	England in Pakistan: Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum restore joy to Test cricket	"It stands to reason that you are more likely to be good at something if you enjoy doing it.
Going to work, doing the garden, learning the whamola. You get the idea.
For a long time, the only thing less enjoyable than playing for the England Test team was watching them.
Not so much shutting the curtains if they were playing in the backyard, but asking the police to escort them away and taking out a restraining order so they could never again set foot in the same county.
ransformation under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum is absolute not only in terms of results - nine wins in 10 Tests capped with a historic 3-0 victory in Pakistan - but the restoration of joy to every aspect of England's Test cricket.
New Zealander McCullum is a man who always looks like he is a having a good time, but Stokes knows what it is to struggle - it was only 14 months ago that he ended a hiatus from the game.
""Very early on in the summer, I tried to describe to the lads that we're in the entertainment business,"" said Stokes.
""Go out and entertain the people who watch us. Try to make every day of a Test as entertaining and watchable as we can. Enjoy the moment.""
All of which is a perfectly reasonable aim, but much harder to put into practice.
Professional athletes are often wracked with self-doubt. It is a rare career where you know that there is always someone out there looking to pinch your place in the team, or squad, and essentially take your job.
Keith Miller, all-rounder in Don Bradman's Invincibles and a World War II pilot, once said pressure is a Messerschmitt on your tail - ""playing cricket is not"".
Pressure, though, can be all-consuming for a cricketer and often comes from within.
It is perhaps, therefore, the removal of pressure that is key to the success of the Stokes-McCullum regime.
After the innings defeat inside three days by South Africa in the first Test at Lord's, England's only loss under the Ben-Baz axis, Stokes returned to the dressing room, unsure what to say.
""The lads were a little bit down,"" he recalled. ""The first thing I said was 'right lads, put your hand up if you want to play golf'. 
""They were looking at each other. I'll never forget the relief on their faces, because they were wondering what would be said after we'd been beaten so badly. That lifted the weight off shoulders.""
Pressure taken away, fun added.
raining can include a penalty shootout, or a game where a helmeted coach tries to head a tennis ball dropping from orbit. McCullum's questionable taste in music is often the soundtrack to a net session.
fore the final Test in Karachi, the squad held a six-hitting contest, North v South, then Stokes v McCullum. The coach's victory meant the captain had to serve dinner to Harry Brook that night.
In the build-up to the Pakistan series, England went to the Abu Dhabi F1 Grand Prix, before the tour of New Zealand in February they will meet for a holiday in Queenstown. McCullum says he is looking forward to showing the team around his homeland, probably with a glass of red in his hand.
If this sounds like the world's longest stag do, it is all part of a wider plan to keep the players as relaxed as possible so they are in a better position to perform at the peak of their powers.
re is a time for business, too. Practice sessions, often optional, are targeted and tailored so not a moment is wasted.
""I feel in cricket that a lot of training sessions are for the sake of it and you don't get much out of it,"" said Stokes. 
""You just go there because it's the thing to be seen to do. There has to be an outcome for that effort, not turning up, rolling your arm over, having a bat for 30 mins but not getting anything out of it and not improving as a player.""
utcome has been spectacular, not only in terms of results, but the way in which they have been achieved.
Run chases against New Zealand at Trent Bridge and India at Edgbaston were the most fun anyone could legally have with their clothes on. Racking up 506-4 in 75 overs on the first day against Pakistan in Rawalpindi bent cricketing logic.
By the time they got to the third Test against Pakistan, England were in full on hysterics. Not content with making Rehan Ahmed the youngest man to ever play Test cricket for England, Ahmed went and picked up 5-48 like a kid with the cheat code to Brian Lara Cricket.
me England that refused to chase 273 in 75 overs against New Zealand at Lord's 18 months ago tried to knock off 167 in Karachi in the hour and a bit remaining on the third day. No-one was the least bit surprised when they sent out Ahmed out at number three.
Not that Stokes' side only play in one way. They can do the hard yards.
Beating South Africa by an innings in the second Test in difficult and ever-changing conditions at Old Trafford was probably their best performance of the summer. The 1,512 balls England had to send down to take 20 wickets on the dormant Rawalpindi pitch was the most they have bowled in a Test win for 30 years.
Multan, with Abrar Ahmed spinning his way to 11 wickets, and third Test in Karachi, where they lost the toss, are matches England teams of old would have folded in. For all the talk of Bazball, the tourists altered their style at various points in both.
Looking to the future, England's biggest problem will be fitting all of their players into an XI. Stuart Broad, Jofra Archer and Jonny Bairstow will all be available at some point in 2023.
re is a question over how they might respond if results take a turn for the worse, which all England fans will be hoping does not happen in an Ashes series that is shaping up to be the most eagerly anticipated in years.
""You guys do this all the time. Let's just enjoy 3-0,"" said McCullum, when the prospect of the Australians was raised.
Perhaps it is left to the rest of us to get excited about the Ashes.
For now, England are having too much fun."

2021 All-Ireland champions relinquished their Ulster title at the quarter-final stage with defeat by eventual winners Derry.
was followed by exiting the Sam Maguire qualifiers at the hands of rivals Armagh.
Hampsey says this year has left the Red Hands with a ""point to prove"".
""A strange one, getting time off over the summer. I got to go away on holiday which was the first time in six or seven years,"" said Hampsey.
""We'll get the batteries recharged, get back to Garvaghey in the winter months and get training hard because we know we have a point to prove. 
""We know we didn't perform to our best ability this year. We've to get the Tyrone people behind us again and get the thing going again.""
Having retained their Division One status despite an up-and-down National League campaign, Tyrone were dismantled by Derry in devastating fashion in a gripping Ulster quarter-final in Omagh.
Red Hand hopes of becoming the first Tyrone team to successfully defend an All-Ireland title were then dashed by Armagh, who won 1-16 to 1-10 in the qualifiers at the Athletic Grounds.
But Hampsey, who is back with his club Coalisland ahead of the start of the Tyrone SFC, insists the county will approach 2023 with renewed enthusiasm as they look to dethrone Derry and Kerry as Ulster and All-Ireland champions respectively. 
""Any day you put on a Tyrone jersey, you go out to do the team proud and the jersey proud. But look, things just didn't get going this year. It's hard to put a finger on it. The Ulster Championship is such a tough competition, it's tough to get going because you're going up against big opposition. 
""The likes of Derry, they had a great year. They done well to win the Ulster Championship and the likes of Armagh beating us in the qualifiers, we were really disappointed getting beaten that day in the Athletic Grounds.
""But the lads will come back with that bit of hunger and fight for next year because we have a young enough panel and we'll hopefully push on.""
While the Tyrone seniors struggled in 2022, it was a memorable year for the Under-20s who claimed the county's sixth All-Ireland title at the grade in May. 
Stars of that team such as Ruairi Canavan and Michael McGleenan have already been promoted to the senior panel and Hampsey believes they can serve to breathe new life into the county. 
""We saw how good the Under-20s were in the championship,"" added Hampsey.
""They got their opportunity to step up to the seniors and they're training hard. We know the ability those lads have and they're real good lads as well, they look after themselves off the pitch. 
""Hopefully those lads can push on."""

Jepchirchir beat world record holder Brigid Kosgei in the closing stages to win in two hours 27 minutes 20 seconds.
American Molly Seidel took bronze after Israel's Lonah Chemtai Salpeter stopped inside the final five kilometres.
Contested in 28C heat, the race was moved from 07:00 to 06:00 local time due to the forecast temperatures.
Stephanie Davis, the 2021 British champion, finished 39th in 2:36:33.
Compatriots Steph Twell - making her third Olympic appearance at a third different distance after entering the 1500m in 2008 and 5,000m in 2016 - placed 68th in 2:53:26, while Jessica Piasecki was 71st in 2:55:39.
Kenyan team boasted three of the five fastest female marathon runners of all time, but world champion Ruth Chepngetich - who defied the heat and humidity of Doha in 2019 to win gold - pulled up after losing touch with the leaders at 30km.
Jepchirchir and Kosgei were joined by Seidel and Salpeter in the lead group with five kilometres remaining, before the Kenyan pair moved clear and Seidel pushed on following European 10,000m champion Salpeter's abrupt withdrawal to win bronze in just her third outing over the distance.
Kosgei, a two-time London marathon winner who broke Britain's Paula Radcliffe's 16-year-old world record with a time of 2:14:04 at the Chicago Marathon in October 2019, finished 16 seconds behind Jepchirchir and 10 seconds ahead of Seidel.
Both the marathon and race walking events at the Games were moved 500 miles north of Tokyo to Japan's northern city of Sapporo because of the summer heat in Japan's capital.
A total of 14 athletes failed to complete the distance in Sapporo, compared to 74 finishers."
sports	Aaliyah Powell: Overcoming taekwondo ‘fear’ and rivalling Jade Jones	"""When I first started taekwondo I hated sparring and I was really scared!""
Aaliyah Powell wanted nothing to do with the combat side of her sport as a 10-year-old. 
Fast-forward almost a decade and she has not only become a junior world champion, but also broke Jade Jones' record as Britain's youngest-ever senior world medallist.
19-year-old is now the double Olympic champion's biggest rival for a place at Paris 2024.
Powell's rise is all the more impressive given she sustained a serious knee ligament injury that threatened to derail her career.
On Sunday, Powell aims to remind rivals of her prowess when she goes head-to-head with her ""idol"" in the same -57kg division at the European Championships in Manchester.
""Europeans will be exciting, especially with us both being in the same category,"" she tells BBC Sport. ""I'm pushing to achieve the same goal as her, which is gold in Paris.""
Powell laughs when reflecting on the ""fear"" she experienced when first stepping on to the mat. Back then, the girl from Huddersfield had other dreams.
""I originally thought fencing looked fun, but I was too young and after watching my cousin do a taekwondo taster session, I followed her,"" she says.
""I said I'd do it for one or two years until I was old enough to drop it for fencing, but I've been doing it ever since.""
She initially ""fell in love"" with the more traditional form of the martial art - the Poomsea discipline - which sees players assessed on their ability to perform sets of movements, such as kicks, blocks and punches in a 'meaningful order' in response to imaginary attacks.
""My coach would have to stand behind me and force me to fight people otherwise I'd run away,"" she recalls. 
""As I got older the tactical elements hooked me though, and once I got over the fear of fighting, I progressed very quickly.""
Powell began to realise she could have a career in the sport after winning her maiden international title - Dutch Open cadet gold - in 2016.
Euro Youth silver (2017) and World Junior gold (2018) followed before a 'shock' senior British team call-up for the 2019 World Championships in Manchester.
""I was still a junior athlete, I wasn't full-time and my dad just put the application in on a whim on the last day it could be submitted,"" she recalls.
""I didn't think I'd get the pick and when I did, I was shocked and didn't want to do it.
""In fact, I said 'I'm not doing it!' because when you're a junior taking on seniors it is really daunting and I was scared.""
Powell was eventually convinced to compete and despite the event taking place during her GCSE exams the then 16-year-old stunned the home crowd - and taekwondo community - by securing what she describes as an ""overwhelming"" -53kg bronze.
She soon became a full-time member of the senior GB Taekwondo programme, joining the likes of Jones as well as fellow Olympic medallists Bianca Walkden and Lauren Williams.
Dreams of immediate sustained senior success were soon dashed, though, after partially tearing knee ligaments, before a complete rupture of her meniscus in late 2019.
""I cried a lot at the beginning,"" admits Powell, who feared for her future in the sport.
""I had to have a couple of surgeries and on top of that there was Covid and lockdown, which stopped me training and halted my progress for sure, but it's given me a lot of mental resilience which will hopefully help me in my career.""
fighter says she has drawn ""confidence"" from speaking with team-mate Walkden, who returned from three potentially career-ending knee injuries before claiming the first of her three world titles.
Since her own comeback, Powell has claimed bronze at the World Taekwondo Women's Championship and silver at the Swedish Open last month - losing 9-5 to Jones in the final.
""We're the same weight, only one of us can go [to the Olympics]. I'm looking to achieve it for the first time and obviously she's been really successful for a long time,"" says Powell.
""It's hard for both of us,"" she continues, ""but I think we both really push one another and make each other better.""
2022 Europeans - which run from 19-22 May - are the first major event of the Paris 2024 qualification cycle and Powell has only one target as she begins the race for GB's sole Olympic -57kg berth.
""Gold is what I'm going for,"" she states. ""It's what I want and for me it would just show the hard work, sacrifice and perseverance to push through the injury was worth it."""

sports	Kelly Catlin: A family's search for answers on links between concussion and suicide	"In January 2019, on a sunny day in the coastal mountains surrounding San Francisco, an Olympic medal-winning cyclist was racing down a twisting ribbon of tarmac, descending at the kind of blistering speed reserved for cars and motorbikes.
On a surface that had dried quickly after the first rainfall for weeks, Kelly Catlin suddenly lost control.
Her bike flew out from underneath her and tumbled down the hillside, coming to a stop in a cloud of dust. She was carried forward and skidded across the road, tumbling several times. 
Catlin knew the drill of the hardened cyclist: jump up, survey the bike, examine the burning road rash and torn Lycra, get back up and finish the ride.
She seemed OK. She headed home. Later she spoke with her mum on the phone.
""She was telling me about it and kind of laughing,"" Catlin's mother Carolyn Emory told BBC World Service. 
""I asked her: 'Did you check your helmet?' 'No it's fine,' she said. But then she did check and it had dents on the front and back.""
Catlin didn't realise at the time, but she had suffered a concussion. Soon after, she began to experience painful and confusing symptoms. Her mood and behaviour changed, she became anxious and depressed. Her family was worried - she no longer seemed herself. 
wo months later, Catlin had taken her own life. She was 23. 
Looking for answers has been a long, painful and complex journey for her family. 
But they believe doing so will help raise awareness about an issue that sport - and especially cycling - has for too long ignored.
One of triplets, Catlin was a gifted athlete growing up. She seemed destined to achieve in almost any sport she liked. She was an especially talented football player, but when injuries saw her take up cycling as a way of keeping fit on the sidelines, there was no going back.
""It was like she was born with this drive or obsessiveness. Not to be an Olympic athlete necessarily, but to excel or to be good at something,"" says her father Mark.
""Anything she focused on, she really focused. Art, Chinese… With school assignments she would do it and go beyond. Cycling was the thing it got channelled into.""
By the time of her crash, Catlin was a postgraduate computer science student at Stanford University in California, a three-time world track cycling champion in the team pursuit and an Olympics silver medallist with the United States. 
She was out that day as part of her training with professional team Rally Cycling, one of America's best. She had no idea how seriously her injuries would go on to affect her.
Weeks afterwards, she was still in constant pain and discomfort. Doctors' diagnoses could not pinpoint exactly what was wrong.
""She went to Germany for a World Cup thing, but she couldn't do it because she had severe headaches,"" says Carolyn. ""She stayed an extra week after the team left because she couldn't cope with the airport lights and the noise."" 
Mark adds: ""She went to the Olympic Training Centre (OTC) and had a whole bunch of scans which didn't show up an awful lot.
""Then things went downhill. They put her on some therapy for dizziness, light sensitivity and headaches. She had eye exercises. They trained her with all sorts of monitors and oxygen and blood pressure - all that stuff. Something was definitely wrong.""
Catlin attempted suicide at the end of January 2019, but did not succeed. 
""Part of her brain knew it was too much after the first attempt,"" says Carolyn. ""She gave us her word she would not try again. 
""But she talked to her sister on the phone a couple of days before she killed herself and said she was still thinking about it. She referred to: 'If things don't change in a month…' 
""It was almost a goodbye."" 
Mark adds: ""She gave us her word, but in fact I think she just said that to get out of hospital. The staff realised it wasn't the right thing to do to let her go, but she was going to get a lawyer - she was determined to get out.""
Soon after Catlin's phone call with her sister, and following a campus wellness check initiated by Carolyn after a series of unanswered phone calls, Catlin was found dead in her apartment at Stanford in March 2019. 
Her father Mark believes his daughter would still be alive had her symptoms, which included depression and anxiety, been recognised as evidence of post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Catlin had suffered several concussions - the crash was not her first - but the link was not made.
If it had been, Mark believes, Catlin would have followed guidance to take several weeks' full rest, after which time, in many cases, PCS symptoms ease and patients recover. However, continuing to combine her cycling and studies, Catlin had been as busy as ever; determined to achieve, restless and intense in her pursuit of excellence, just like she always was.
Catlin's family believe the symptoms she was experiencing, combined with this complex edge to her personality, proved too much for her; a woman whose drive for perfection was focused on fulfilling potential.
According to the Washington Post,external-link her diaries later revealed she lived by a set of guidelines which included ""I do not cry"". 
We often see elite sport as the pinnacle of human performance. With it comes a perception that an athlete cannot be too dedicated in their pursuit of glory, that practice makes perfect. We think of their resilience or stoicism in the same way. A 'we go again' philosophy many champions possess.
Catlin referred to this herself in a blog post for the website VeloNews, published in late February 2019, shortly before her death.
She wrote: ""As athletes, we are all socially programmed to be stoic with our pain, to bear our burdens and not complain, even when such stoicism reaches the point of stupidity and those burdens begin to damage us. These are hard habits to break.
""The truth is that most of the time, I don't make everything work. It's like juggling with knives, but I really am dropping a lot of them. It's just that most of them hit the floor and not me.""
Brain injury remains poorly understood in the sporting world. Only in recent years has awareness begun to grow around the degenerative condition chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and its links with repeated blows to the head, and/or concussion. 
UK charity Headway has played a major role in developing interventions to mitigate against risks facing athletes, while also campaigning for wider understanding of post-concussion syndrome, too. 
Because while CTE tends to develop later in life, with symptoms similar to Alzheimer's disease and can currently only be fully diagnosed post-mortem, PCS is experienced in the immediate weeks or months after a concussion. 
A key phrase from Headway's campaign work is: 'If in doubt, sit it out.' The reality of the cycling world can often be found a long way from that message. 
In road cycling, a rider must quickly get back on their bike following a crash to avoid losing touch with the peloton and missing a time limit, causing elimination. 
Last year's men's road cycling season saw some high-profile instances of concussion - one during each of the three Grand Tour races. The most concerning came at the 2020 Tour de France, in which Frenchman Romain Bardet crashed on stage 13. 
He was contesting the lead of the race, but after crashing was clearly disorientated when he was lifted on to his feet, and his legs gave way and he collapsed. Within a minute he was back on his bike. He finished the 192km stage before it was revealed he not only had concussion, but had suffered a brain haemorrhage. 
Several of Catlin's USA Cycling counterparts have highlighted their concerns over concussions they suffered during their careers on the track, including 2020 world time trial champion Chloe Dygert and US time trial champion Carmen Small, who says her career was eventually ended by it. 
""All athletes want to keep pushing when they should probably stop,"" Small has said. ""I still have headaches. I was never diagnosed, but I remember being out of it for four days in a dark room and having vertigo for six weeks.""
Since Catlin's death, USA Cycling has launched a wellbeing programme and ""multiple strategic initiatives aimed at changing the narrative around mental health"".
re are some other early signs of progress. 
On Friday, the UK government published new plans to develop protocolsexternal-link around concussion in sport, following a July report from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. 
Cycling's governing body the UCI has introduced new measures to better ensure the safety of athletes following head injuries. Team members will be trained to recognise the signs of concussion, record every incident centrally and follow a set time limit for recovery and returning to competition.  
And during this year's Paris-Nice, Britain's 2020 Giro d'Italia champion Tao Geoghegan Hart was pulled out of the race after his team Ineos Grenadiers opted for caution - a move which was widely praised.
Following Catlin's death, her parents donated her brain to the Concussion Legacy Foundation Brain Bank at Boston University to aid further research into the effects of concussion. 
In a statement released at the same time, her father Mark identified four areas of possible cause: Personality, stress, overtraining and concussion. 
Mark says: ""Kelly was such a complex individual and very private - one who kept a lot of feelings inside and kept a veneer of: 'I'm an iron woman.' 
""She wouldn't reveal her emotional or psychical situation, probably to anybody. She kept pushing herself when she shouldn't have been. It all had a cumulative effect on her, a very strong woman brought down by that combination.
""It's like part of us is torn out. I wake up every morning with a sense of disbelief she's gone. Every night I wake up and play over and over in my head: 'If only I'd done this…'
Carolyn adds: ""We don't want any other athletes to go through this. Short of getting Kelly back, we just want to get the right programme to help folk before it's too late.
""I just wish she was still here.""

flight will carry equipment from the grounds of Stracathro Hospital, Brechin, to Invergowrie, near Dundee's Ninewells Hospital.
It is hoped the service could be adopted by NHS Tayside in the future to reduce transport times.
rvice is being trialled by the health board and Mercury Drone Ports.
rial route has been approved by the Federal Aviation Authority.
Future trials will carry supplies and samples between other healthcare facilities in Dundee and Angus.
Angus Council leader Beth Whiteside said she hoped the trial would demonstrate how it could help reduce testing times and speed up diagnoses for patients.
NHS Tayside said it hoped the trial would help develop and improve its supply chain, and provide an equitable level of healthcare, regardless of a patient's geographical location.
Chris Hind, the health board's diagnostics laboratories interim quality manager, said: ""NHS Tayside plans to extend phlebotomy testing hours at some regional medical practices. 
""We are very interested in testing additional logistical support to transport patient samples, which would permit samples to be taken at later times than currently possible for delivery to the main testing lab at Ninewells Hospital.""   
Mercury Drone Ports is a public-private partnership between Angus Council and drone company DTLX.
It is providing a trial airspace area to allow other drone firms and their clients to conduct test flights.
It is being funded from the UK government's £26.5m Angus Fund, as part of the Tay Cities Region Deal."
technology	Why is Elon Musk spending his time on Twitter, not on the mission to Mars?	"I have been watching Elon Musk for a number of years - and more closely than ever in recent months, since he decided, seemingly on a whim, to buy the social network Twitter.
He is one of the world's richest men - sometimes the richest, depending on the price of Tesla shares, his main financial asset. With a string of other high-profile companies under his wing, including Tesla, Space X, Starlink, and Neuralink, he is also a subject of global fascination. 
, of course, there is his own personal story - the tall, 51-year-old billionaire with 10 children ranging in age from one to 18. His first son died aged just 10 weeks. Musk, who was born in South Africa, has described living with Asperger's syndrome, a type of autism, and stated that his main goal in life is to colonise Mars. 
What I have learned is - as, perhaps, with many of us - there are many different faces of Elon Musk.
rsona he projects via his prolific tweets is provocative, controversial and bombastic. He loves a rude meme, knows whatever he says will make headlines around the world, and enjoys trolling the media with ever more outlandish statements and jokes. He likes trying to goad us journalists into writing ever more extreme headlines.
In public, he has learned to be a showman, whether dancing alongside electric-car-making robots, emerging triumphantly from the latest slick Tesla prototype, or being filmed walking into Twitter's headquarters carrying a sink - ""Let that sink in"" was the gag, playing off a popular meme on the site. This Halloween, he attended a party in leather armour, a $7,500 costume called ""the devil's champion"".
And yet Tallulah Riley, his ex-wife, whom he married twice, described him in BBC documentary series The Elon Musk Show as ""sweet"" and ""shy"". 
Veteran Silicon Valley journalist and author Mike Malone, who has known Mr Musk for 20 years, tells me he sees  ""a very reserved, very smart, very introspective and intellectual guy"" who spends long transatlantic flights with him reading complex trajectory tables, trying to work out how to land a spacecraft on Mars. 
r have a long-standing $5 (£4) bet over Mr Musk's ambition to send people to Mars by 2030. ""I said, 'I don't think you can do it - but I hope you do. I hope I owe you the $5,'"" Mr Malone says. ""That bet's still floating in the air"".
Sending people to Mars is a lifelong goal for Mr Musk. Some say it is his take on long-termism - a philosophy favoured by some very rich people which seeks to act in the interests of billions of people in the far future, rather than focusing on the immediate needs of the present.
At some point, the human race is going to have to leave Earth, he says. And his interest in space is clearly signposted in his existing business portfolio. But where, on Earth, does Twitter fit in? 
Mr Musk answered that question, this week - in a tweet.
""Social media in general, especially Twitter, were eroding civilisation,"" he wrote. ""If civilisation collapses before Mars becomes self-sustaining, then nothing else matters. Human consciousness is gone.""
But how was Twitter ""eroding civilisation""? 
Mr Musk said, at the very beginning, his aim in buying the platform was to create a 21st Century digital, global town square for discussing society's big issues. 
He has written many times about perceived imbalance under the previous regime, arguing that right-leaning views were given less visibility by Twitter staff than left-leaning ones, skewing debate and creating echo chambers where nobody saw material that challenged their existing viewpoint. With some handpicked journalists, he published the ""Twitter files"", a selected set of internal documents, to support his view.
mount of abuse and misinformation thrown around on the platform could also be seen as distracting from the real issues Mr Musk wants discussed.
But as anyone who has ever tried will know, navigating that tightrope between allowing free speech and suppressing hateful content is very, very hard.
Maybe there is a connection somewhere in Mr Musk's mind between Twitter and Neuralink, which is trying to create a direct link between human brains and computers. 
Could it be that Twitter forms part of his research and he has essentially bought himself a living, breathing neural network of 300 million people sharing their lives, and opinions, in real time, online? 
OK, we are in the realms of science fiction. But transporting that to another planet in some form would be one way of taking human consciousness away from Earth - and we know Mr Musk likes a challenge.
Mr Malone may never see his $5 - and betting against Mr Musk is generally a bad idea, entrepreneur Dolly Singh, who worked with him for six years at SpaceX, until 2013, says.
""I would, by rule, never bet against him,"" she says.
""Anything that's a machine - hands down, he's going to win.""  
But Ms Singh also thinks Twitter presents her former boss with a different challenge. 
""This is going to be harder than he has anticipated - and it's going to be a lot of work for him,"" she says.
Mr Musk has talked openly about preferring engineering and code to people. Growing up, he did not understand people did not necessarily say what they meant, he told a Technology, Entertainment, Design (Ted) conference in Vancouver, last year.
In a text message, released as part of court papers for a legal case against Twitter that never actually happened, he wrote: ""I interface way better with engineers who are able to do hardcore programming than with program managers/MBA [Master of Business Administration] types of people and/or frankly I hate doing mgmt [management] stuff. I kinda don't think anyone should be the boss of anyone. But I love helping solve technical/product design problems.""
His problem is that Twitter is one huge messy network of millions of people shouting, laughing, teasing, trolling, arguing - loud, complex and nuanced. 
Mr Musk has already struggled with trying to moderate it, even with a promise of a lighter touch than the previous regime. 
And Ms Singh is not the only observer to ask whether he will find it more difficult to run smoothly than he imagined. 
As a businessman and a leader, he can be brutal - although arguably no more so than other chief executives. 
Within one week of buying Twitter, he had laid off half the workforce. Those remaining were asked to sign contracts committing to an ""intense"" work ethic and long hours. 
Pre-Twitter, he was one of the first to call for the staff of all his companies to be back at the workplace full time following pandemic lockdowns. 
And he will not tolerate less than 100% commitment from his employees.
Ms Singh describes the Musk she knew as an ""incredible leader"", determined to ""prove everybody wrong"" when told he cannot achieve something, and, as is often said about him, a phenomenally hard worker.
""Elon wants to live in a world where he works 80 hours a week,"" she says.
""It's OK for him to say, 'I expect you to work as hard as me,' because he's not phoning it in from the beach, he's sleeping in a sleeping bag on the factory floor.""
Most people, she says, burn out after a while. He does not.
He has installed beds in Twitter's San Francisco headquarters, seemingly for his staff - although, he is understood to be sleeping there himself. He even shared a picture of his two-year-old son, X, wearing a company pass. 
Others who worked with him in the 1990s also recall his extraordinary work ethic. He was furious, one said, to find nobody in the office at 21:00 on a Friday night.
Ms Singh says his time is Mr Musk's most precious commodity. 
""Think about what it's worth, per second,"" she says. 
You do not need to do the maths to know it is eye-watering. 
And right now, he is pouring it all into Twitter. 
Perhaps Mr Malone should not spend his $5 just yet.

technology	Robot with 'brain' near Cheltenham sorting plastic waste	"A waste management company is trialling the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to sort plastic waste.
Grundon has invested in a robotic arm at its Bishop's Cleeve site in Gloucestershire which can pick rubbish at ""a human rate"".
Zen Robotics machine learns to remember plastic in a similar way to which humans learn to recognise items.
mpany hopes the technology will increase the volume of recyclable material Grundon can capture.
'Fast Picker' arm is supplied by Helsinki-based supplier of robotic waste separation technology - Zen Robotics.
It works by scanning rubbish on a belt before deciding which items to pick - the robot then has an ""in-belt brain"" of information which it retains through training.
Over time, as more items are picked, the ""brain"" identifies more waste streams, storing the information in its AI memory.
Government statistics show the UK generated almost 44 million tonnes of commercial and industrial waste in 2018.
mate for England - in 2020 - was almost 34 million tonnes.
Once plastic trials are complete, Grundon will begin training the robot to pick steel or aluminium cans, paper and cardboard.
Ed Fagan, Grundon's head of projects, said: ""Both optical and robotic sorters can be deployed alongside humans in our waste sorting facilities.
""But where we can really see robotic sorters making a difference is in environments which are less well suited for humans, such as the sorting of contaminated waste or working in areas with high levels of noise and dust.""

technology	Ruja Ignatova: Leaked police notes may have alerted FBI-wanted Cryptoqueen	"Ruja Ignatova, also known as the ""missing Cryptoqueen"", received police information about investigations into her $4bn (£3.5bn) cryptocurrency fraud before she disappeared, it is claimed.
42-year-old Bulgarian-born woman is wanted for her alleged role in running a cryptocurrency scam known as OneCoin.
Files seen by the BBC from Europol meetings suggest the FBI-wanted fugitive knew about efforts to arrest her months before she vanished. 
uments were passed to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast by Frank Schneider, a former spy and trusted adviser to Ms Ignatova.
Mr Schneider denies obtaining the documents, which he says were passed to him on a USB memory stick by Ms Ignatova. He claims metadata on the files suggests she obtained the information via her own contacts in Bulgaria. 
He is now facing extradition to the US for his alleged role in the OneCoin fraud. 
Europol said it was looking into the issue. 
Ms Ignatova disappeared on 25 October 2017 after being tipped off about intensifying police investigations into her OneCoin cryptocurrency. In June 2022, she was added to the FBI's 10 most wanted list.
files contain presentations made at an ""Operation Satellite"" Europol meeting in The Hague on 15 March 2017.
According to the documents, the meeting was attended by the FBI, the US Department of Justice and the New York District Attorney. Officers from the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Dubai and Bulgaria were also present.
uments include details of US authorities having a ""high-placed confidential informant"", OneCoin bank accounts receiving investor funds, and unsuccessful efforts by the UK's City of London Police to interview Ms Ignatova.
FBI did not comment on the Europol documents, but Special Agent Paul Roberts told the podcast: ""There were investigations all around the world into her, and into OneCoin generally, many of which she had become aware of due to actions by law enforcement in other countries.""
In court, US prosecutors alleged in 2019 that Mr Schneider was the one who provided her with confidential police information, although it is not clear if the allegations relate specifically to the leaked files seen by the podcast.
He has denied obtaining the documents and said: ""When the Bulgarians participated at certain Europol meetings, it only took hours for her to get a complete rundown and get the minutes of what was said in those meetings.
""I can only deduce that it came from the circles that she was in and the connections that she had through a variety of influential personalities.""
uments show attendees from Bulgaria's Interior Ministry at the March 2017 Europol meeting. The BBC asked the ministry whether its staff could be responsible for the leak, but it did not comment. 
No other law enforcement bodies in attendance would confirm how the information got out. 
Europol told the BBC it was looking into the matter, adding: ""This complex scenario with many stakeholders makes it difficult to assess where and how such an incident might have occurred.""
US Department of Justice, New York County District Attorney's Office, and Dubai Police did not comment.
Listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast on BBC Sounds - the search for Dr Ruja Ignatova continues, with a new episode about the police leak out on 19 October.

technology	Twitter: Romance, business and campaigns born on the platform	"For those who work there and those who use it, Twitter continues to be on a rollercoaster under the leadership of Elon Musk, who bought the firm for $44bn (£36.3m) at the end of October.
umult has brought into sharper focus some of the platform's failings. Like all social networks, Twitter has long grappled with problems regarding privacy, hate speech and abuse.
But for some of its roughly 300 million monthly users, it has also been a place where they have built businesses, found love, launched campaigns and raised awareness for issues that are important to them.
I spoke to three women who say being on Twitter changed their lives for the better.
Catherine Cooke is a teaching assistant 
I didn't start out looking for romance. But what I did use Twitter for was support, it's quite an isolating thing going through a divorce. And you can of course talk to real-life friends and family, but sometimes they're a little bit too close. Sometimes it's just very useful to have a sounding board. 
You can have a vent and a rant. And there's somebody there who will either be sympathetic or maybe tell you off, but you will definitely get a reaction, and probably some quite honest feedback as well. I started off really using Twitter as a bit of a diary.
Along the way, I found lots of people who were going through the same thing or had been through the same thing, and had useful information or advice.
As far as the romance side of it goes, really that came out of friendships I'd made on Twitter. I like music and I got chatting to people about it. One of those people eventually ended up being my partner. But it did start out in friendship, a shared love of music and general chit-chat.
I love Twitter. There's so many people out there that I feel very, very strongly about even though we've never met, which does sound a bit weird. Online friends are a different sort of friend from real-life friends, but they're really important. I feel like I couldn't have got through the last couple of years without those people. I'm very positive about Twitter, I think it can be an absolute force for good.
witter has changed my life, I can't believe I'm actually saying that but it's true. I've gone from being on my own and going through divorce, to feeling that I've met the love of my life. I would never have met him if it hadn't been for Twitter. I feel really, really lucky.
Gail Myerscough is an illustrator and pattern designer
witter has been amazing. I've got 18,400 followers, so I've got a real audience for my work. But it's also been really supportive. People have been with me on my journey. I was made redundant in Covid - this was my side hustle and then it became my full-time job. I also met my husband on Twitter. 
I've got brand ambassadors now on Twitter who retweet me, I've got repeat customers. I've worked with some amazing people. Tim Burgess from the band The Charlatans contacted me one day and said, ""I really like your work"". And then he asked me to design a turntable for him. So we designed a limited-edition turntable - it was brilliant.
I get a lot of traffic from Twitter.  I do have Instagram, but the algorithms and engagement make it more difficult to get people to look at your work.
I'm really worried about what's happening [since Elon Musk took over] because like I say, a lot of my business and support comes from Twitter. If Twitter went, I'd have to build my business elsewhere, and I don't know where that would be to get the same engagement and orders. 
Suw Charman-Anderson founded Ada Lovelace Day, an annual celebration of women working in Stem (science, tech, engineering and maths)
I started the Ada Lovelace Day Twitter account at the end of 2008. And at that point, the idea of having a day celebrating women in Stem - well it was just an idea. I didn't have any resources or any way to reach people. Twitter was the obvious solution. In all honesty, I don't think Ada Lovelace Day would have become the movement that it did without the help of Twitter.
We have 40% of our audience in the UK, and about 40% in North America. The other 20% is in about 150 countries around the world. So we have followers from across South America, Africa, Asia, it has allowed us to reach people in countries where the media isn't going to pick us up.
With a bit of care, it has been possible to curate an experience on Twitter that is generally pleasant. Obviously, there is always the opportunity for things to go wrong. I have experienced the Twitter pile-on - not quite becoming the main character thankfully, but adjacent to it - and that is never pleasant. 
But overall, I think it has been a positive experience for me and I am grateful to Twitter for allowing Ada Lovelace Day to flourish in the way that it has. I see other organisations for women in Stem and all sorts of other things that exist because Twitter connects them with their community and their audience in a way that other tools just don't. 
I just don't see the same level of engagement on Facebook or LinkedIn for example. I think Twitter is interesting, it's unique in its properties, and I would be really heartbroken if it did break permanently or if we saw a huge drop off in numbers.

Kate McKenzie, from Duston, Northampton, created a tool called Word Windows, which will now be known as Word Window.
She said Microsoft had opposed her trademark but she could now launch the product with the new name.

""The premise is you can put on top of the book your child is reading so you can reduce it so you can read with whatever bit of the word they are struggling with,"" Mrs McKenzie said.
She said she created the device as she struggled with reading at school due to dyslexia and her son was facing similar issues.
Nine days before the product was due to go to market, on 1 July, she received a letter from lawyers representing Microsoft.
But she told BBC Radio Northampton: ""Everything is now resolved, the packaging has been reprinted, all the bits and pieces have been changed in terms of the website.""
Mrs McKenzie said although the name has slightly changed ""the product is the same"".
She will be launching the invention at Northamptonshire Central Library, in Northampton, on Saturday, which she was ""feeling a little bit nervous about"".
Mrs McKenzie said: ""One of the aspects of my dyslexia is I can find myself stumbling and stuttering over words.
""But the actual chance to launch the business to get started and to start to help parents and the children is very exciting.""
Microsoft previously said to the BBC that it ""cannot comment on ongoing legal matters"".

technology	Floppy disks in Japan: Minister declares war on old-fashioned technology	"Japan's digital minister has ""declared war"" on floppy disks and other retro tech used by the country's bureaucrats.
Around 1,900 government procedures still require businesses to use the storage devices, plus CDs and mini-discs, Taro Kono said. 
He said regulations would be updated to allow people to use online services. 
Despite its reputation for innovative high-tech gadgetry, Japan is notorious for clinging to outmoded technology through its office culture.
Floppy disks - so-called because the original products were bendable - were created in the late 1960s, but were falling out of fashion three decades later thanks to more efficient storage solutions.
More than 20,000 typical disks would be needed to replicate an average memory stick storing 32GB of information.
But the legacy of the square-shaped device can still be witnessed to this day, as their visual appearance inspired the traditional ""save"" icon. 
A Japanese government committee has discovered about 1,900 areas in which businesses are required to use storage media like floppy disks when making applications or holding data. 
During a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Kono also criticised the country's lingering use of other outdated technology.
""I'm looking to get rid of the fax machine, and I still plan to do that,"" he said.
urning to storage devices, he asked: ""Where does one even buy a floppy disk these days?""
first time Japan has hit the headlines for its old-fashioned habits - which remain a paradox given the country's proficiency at developing exciting new products. 
Various explanations have been offered, including poor digital literacy and a bureaucratic culture with conservative attitudes.
re was shock when the country's cyber-security minister admitted in 2018 that he had never used a computer, saying he had always delegated IT tasks to his staff.
And it was not until 2019 that Japan's final pager provider closed its service, with the final private subscriber explaining that it was the preferred method of communication for his elderly mother.
Officials in the US were also discovered to still be using floppy disks to manage their nuclear weapons force during the 2010s - though this practice was reportedly scrapped by the end of the decade."
technology	Instagram: Video selfies trial to verify age of teens	"Instagram is exploring new ways for teenagers to verify their age and comply with platform rules.
Meta-owned app is testing video selfies with facial analysis software as a new age-verification method.
Some users on Instagram try to skirt its 13+ age rule by editing their date of birth to make them appear over 18.
But US teens attempting this will now be given three ways to verify age: upload ID, ask three adult users to vouch for them or take a video selfie.
Meta says it hopes the new methods will ensure teens have an ""age-appropriate experience"" on Instagram. 
giant has previously faced criticism over teen and child safety on its platforms. 
Several US states probed Instagram last year over children's experiences on the photo-sharing app, in response to leaks from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen. 
Will Gardner OBE, chief executive of Childnet and director of the UK Safer Internet Centre, says the trial is encouraging: ""The potential is there to try and help protect children from content which isn't for them and make their internet experience more age-appropriate."" 
5Rights Foundation, a UK organisation campaigning for child safety in the digital environment, says such efforts are ""long overdue"".
Platforms should ""leave behind the 'don't look don't see attitude' that has led to millions of children being put at risk"", 5Rights says, adding that ""simply knowing the age of your users is not enough.""
Parents and guardians of teen Instagram users were given additional tools to supervise their child's experience on Instagram earlier this month. 
w set up time limits and view details of any reports their child makes on the platform.
will also be ""nudged"" to look at other content if repeatedly viewing the same topics on Instagram's explore page, and encouraged to ""take a break"" if continuously scrolling through reels.
Video selfies have become a popular way for digital platforms - such as online banking apps - to verify users' age or identity. 
Instagram currently uses video selfies as one way account holders can verify their identity if they get locked out of their account. 
Meta has partnered with UK digital identification provider Yoti, whose technology estimates age by analysing human faces and facial features.
Yoti says its algorithm, trained on anonymous people's facial images and their date of birth, cannot individually identify users or anything about them, except their age. 
Its latest white paper, published in May, said the technology was accurate for six to 12-year-olds with an error range of 1.36 years - and an error range of 1.52 years for 13 to 19-year-olds. 
Meta says both companies will delete the image once a user's age has been confirmed. 
Meanwhile, social vouching allows users to ask three mutual followers to confirm their age. Those being asked to confirm how old a user is must be at least 18, and cannot be vouching for any other users at the time. 
Dr Ysabel Gerrard, lecturer in digital media and society at the University of Sheffield, says Instagram's new age-verification methods are a welcome addition to just asking users to upload ID. 
But she says relying on age-verification tools as a way to protect young people online can overlook why they actually try to create adult accounts in the first place. 
""A lot of them are saying they're 18 on Instagram not to do bad things or view bad content,"" Dr Gerrard says.
""Being technically registered as an adult makes them feel safe because they don't think they're going to be targeted.""
For Dr Gerrard, Instagram's new verification mechanisms raise larger questions about what helps children to feel safe on social media platforms.
""Pretending to be an adult is one of them. It's a harsh reality, but we can't pretend it's not happening."""

technology	Molly-Mae Hague has Pretty Little Thing Instagram post banned	"Molly-Mae Hague has had another Instagram post banned, this time after she failed to include any mention of it being an ad.
It's the third time the 23-year-old influencer has been in trouble with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).
She posted a picture of her wearing a Pretty Little Thing (PLT) dress, along with a link to buy it, on her story.
ASA said it was not ""immediately clear"" that she had a commercial interest in PLT.
Molly-Mae is a creative director at the company, with PLT confirming their contract expressly stated the requirement for her to include the ""£ad"" disclosure in posts.
Someone who saw the former Love Islander's post on Halloween last year complained, saying the ad didn't make its commercial intent clear.
ASA said: ""We noted that the story had appeared in Molly-Mae Hague's own account and did not contain any indication that it was a marketing communication.""
A spokeswoman for Molly-Mae said the ""#ad"" disclosure had been left off by mistake and would be used in future.
PLT also said it had reminded Molly-Mae of the requirement to prevent any similar mistakes in future.
rd time Molly-Mae has been called out by the ASA since 2020.
But she is by no means the first influencer to have been ticked off for not labelling an ad correctly on social media.
Newsbeat spoke to the ASA's compliance executive Ed Senior last year and he told us that ""overall compliance was disappointing"".
rules say content has to ""be clear, obvious and identifiable as advertising"".
Putting a hashtag #ad is one way, but he says they could also verbally say it's an advert at the start of a video.
""It needs to be clear and obviously up front, prior to engagement. So that's why, even when they added #ad at the end, it wouldn't be enough to comply with the rules,"" Ed said.
But what happens if the rules are broken?
As you'd expect, there are different levels of sanctions.
Ed says the ASA will get someone to amend the content so it follows the rules, or get them to remove it.
If things escalate, people can be placed on a public list, with the ASA working with platforms to remove further content and eventually even referring them to legal authorities.
ASA has told Newsbeat there are measures in place specifically for influencers, including a non-compliance webpage which lists people who fail to label their content as ads - so naming and shaming basically.
From January, there has also been an ""on-platform targeted ads sanction"" on a handful of influencers who have been either unwilling or unable to consistently label when their posts are ads.
""We took out ads on Instagram, specifically flagging influencers who routinely break our rules and warning consumers about their content,"" a spokesman added.
Newsbeat has asked Molly-Mae's management for any additional comment.

technology	Security warning after sale of stolen Chinese data	"President Xi Jinping has urged public bodies to ""defend information security"" after a hacker offered to sell stolen data of one billion Chinese citizens.
In an advert on a criminal forum, later removed, the user said the data was stolen from Shanghai National Police.
ker claims the information includes names, addresses, National ID numbers and mobile phone numbers. 
Cyber-security experts have verified that at least some of a small sample of the data offered is real.
23 terabytes of data is thought to be the largest ever sale of data on record and was being offered for $200,000 (£166,000) until the post was removed on Friday.
No Chinese officials have responded to the news and President Xi did not make direct reference to the data sale.
But, according to the South China Morning Post, the president has asked public bodies in China to ""defend information security… to protect personal information, privacy and confidential corporate information"" to ensure people feel secure when submitting data for public services.
On Friday, the moderators of the website where the sale was listed - by a user called ChinaDan - posted a notice which read: ""Dear Chinese users, welcome to our forum. You most likely came here because of the Shanghai police database leak. The data is no longer being sold, and posts related to this topic have been deleted.""
website administrators then added that they have many other similar and high quality Chinese databases for sale, adding: ""We are not in China and we are not Chinese, so we do not have to obey Chinese laws.""
According to DarkTracer, which monitors cyber criminal activity, another hacker - perhaps inspired by the publicity surrounding ChinaDan's offer - posted an advert on Tuesday for 90 million Chinese citizen records, which the hacker claims to have stolen from Henan National Police (HNGA). None of that data has been verified.
""It remains unclear exactly why the data has been withdrawn,"" Toby Lewis, global head of threat analysis at Darktrace said. 
""The original offer of sale suggests that the hacker was looking to sell the data to several buyers without exclusivity, rather than just one. 
""So one theory is that for a high enough price exclusivity could have been bought, and that kind of purchase could possibly have been made by the Chinese state itself.""
Mr Lewis believes the leaked information could have been a major concern for Chinese authorities which reportedly blocked discussions of the sale on Chinese social networks shortly after it was advertised.
Deb Leary, CEO of Forensic Pathways, also believes the data may have been sold to a high bidder, but adds: ""It's interesting, and not unexpected, that the hacker forum used the incident as a way to promote themselves as a go-to place for stolen data. 
""They don't seem to be worried about angering the Chinese authorities.""
In April a popular hacking website called Raid Forums was seized and shut down in an international police operation led by the FBI. 
's Portuguese founder, and a British man based in Croydon, were arrested.
Large data sets such as the Chinese cache can be used by hackers to send impersonation emails and other malicious attacks to trick people into handing over cash to criminals.
But now the data has disappeared it may never be possible to verify it.
Another theory is that the data and ChinaDan could have been discovered to be fake by the website administrators.
However Louise Ferrett, Threat Analyst at Searchlight Security, thinks the data could well be genuine.
""There are indications that the data on sale was legitimate. Firstly, the source of the data has been reported by some security teams as human error on the part of a government developer,"" she said.
""Secondly, multiple sources have confirmed that the sample data that the seller, known as ChinaDan, provided was legitimate. 
""This doesn't necessarily mean the entire database was real but these two elements combined do certainly make it more likely,"" said Mrs Ferrett. "
technology	UK set to have world's biggest automated drone superhighway	"UK is set to become home to the world's largest automated drone superhighway within the next two years.
rones will be used on the 164-mile Skyway project connecting towns and cities, including Cambridge and Rugby.
It is part of a £273m funding package for the aerospace sector which will be revealed by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng on Monday.
Other projects include drones delivering mail to the Isles of Scilly and medication across Scotland.
Mr Kwarteng is to announce the news at the Farnborough International Airshow - the first to be held since 2019.
He will say the funding will ""help the sector seize on the enormous opportunities for growth that exist as the world transitions to cleaner forms of flight"".
Dave Pankhurst, director of drones at BT, told the BBC that Skyway is about scaling up trials that have been taking place around the UK.
BT is one of the partners involved in the collaboration.
""This drone capability has existed for quite some time, but is in its infancy in terms of being actually part of our society and being a usable application,"" he said. 
""So for us, this is about taking a significant step towards that point. It's going to open up so many opportunities.""
Skyway aims to connect the airspace above Reading, Oxford, Milton Keynes, Cambridge, Coventry and Rugby by mid-2024, and will receive more than £12m.
A total of £105.5m of the government's funding will be specifically for projects relating to ""integrated aviation systems and new vehicle technologies"", including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as drones.
rojects include a plan to use drones to provide regular deliveries of mail and medicine to the Isles of Scilly, and to distribute medicines across Scotland, potentially enabling some cancer patients to be treated in their local community.
Chris Forster, chief operating officer of aviation technology company Altitude Angel, said there were a lot of potential uses for the superhighway.
""Whether it be a business doing logistics, all the way to the police and medical deliveries of vaccines and blood samples, there's a real demand to have access to this airspace,"" he said. 
""We've done a few projects in Africa where the road infrastructure was not good for ground vehicles, and the delivery of vaccines was provided by automated drones.""
gy utilises ground-based sensors installed along the highway which provide a real-time view of where drones are in the airspace.
raffic management system - a sort of air traffic control for drones - which guides them along their routes and avoids collisions.
Steve Wright, associate professor in aerospace engineering at UWE Bristol, said the biggest concern regarding crashes does not come when the drone is in the air, but during take-off or landing.
""It's about the first and last bit of the flight,"" he said. ""The problem is what happens when you're 10 feet away from people. That's the bit I spend my time worrying about. 
""When it's up in the air I know it's stable and it's not going to hit something. 
""People are looking at lowering packages down from the air - in other words you keep the drone well away from people. There's lots of very bright people out there working on flight plans that deliberately avoid built-up areas.""
Mr Pankhurst said the project was working alongside the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to ensure safety. 
""The way they work as an organisation is very evidence-based,"" he said. ""Safety is just paramount in this industry, but importantly, nothing happens without the regulator actually signing it off. 
""The CAA is part of all of these future flight projects. It is part of all of these activities, validating the progress and making sure they're safe.""
He said its research showed that people are more likely to accept a drone if they know it is providing an important service.
Simon Jude, senior lecturer at Cranfield University, said: ""People's knowledge and attitudes might change if they know what that UAV is being used for. If it's an emergency medical support, you're probably going to be a lot more accepting of the noise. 
""So what happens if you get multiple UAVs, or an agricultural use where you might get a number of drones collecting and saving data all at once? 
""I live in a rural location, a very quiet location and it might annoy me more than if you were in a city or an urban landscape where there's lots of other noise."" "
technology	Mario Kart: Next game could be 'victim of current title's success'	"most successful racing video game franchise of all time started with a simple concept.
In 1992, Nintendo released Super Mario Kart on their Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) console.
game was produced by Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto and followed the release of F-Zero - a well-received debut on the console for another popular racing series - but as a single-player experience, the company wanted to take things further.
ment team set out to create a two-player racing game which displayed both players on the same game screen simultaneously. But due to the limitations of the SNES, it wouldn't have been possible to illustrate the futuristic high speeds of F-Zero, so it needed to slow things down a bit. 
As a result, they decided to go with karts. However, it wasn't originally planned to feature Mario, Princess Peach and friends. 
A few months into development, when they had a prototype of two karts featuring generic racers of guys in overalls, they decided to see how Mario would look in the game. According to Miyamoto, everyone agreed it looked better with the inclusion of their famous mascot and so, the Mario Kart series was born.
Industry analyst Serkan Toto of Kantan Games describes the title as a ""system seller"" for the SNES.
""Already back then, Nintendo was leveraging the Mario brand,"" he tells the BBC. ""So they put Mario in there to sell more copies of the game than with, for example, a new character that they would have to come up with.
""It actually made a lot of sense to put characters of the Mario universe into that racing game.""
wer-ups - which are now synonymous with the series - were there, including the ability to throw shells and bananas to hamper opponents as well as collect coins to boost speed. 
It also included battle mode where players attempt to try and pop their opponent's balloons in more open environments, which remains a popular part of the series. 
rty years later, the fun of playing with friends and family remains a huge part of Mario Kart's charm. 
Following the initial game, Nintendo has gone on to release at least one new title for almost all of their subsequent consoles, along with various spin-off titles including a mobile game.
In total, nearly 168 million copies have been sold worldwide and it remains the most popular Mario spin-off game series.
""I think that as far as racing games go, in terms of sales, status or impact on the genre, it's difficult to think of a more influential one than this,"" says Toto.
game's popularity has resulted in the creation of various similar concepts by other developers such as Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing and Crash Team Racing to name a few. 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the Nintendo Switch is the latest release in the main series, and, in February 2022, a paid ""Booster Course Pass"" was announced for the game. The download pack (known in the industry as downloadable content, or DLC) will eventually bring a total of 48 more courses, in six instalments. The new racetracks will include classics from series' history, alongside various new tracks. 
With the release doubling the number of circuits available, much of the gaming community felt it was good value for money and welcomed the update. However, some were left disappointed about the lack of a new entry in the main franchise, five years after the release of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
Furthermore, when the first batch of DLC courses dropped, not all players were happy. 
Some complained that the additional circuits lacked the quality of the game's original content, while it's also been claimed that too many of the new courses are ported from the Mario Kart Tour mobile app, bringing that game's art style with them. 
Eurogamer's Oliver Mackenzie said as part of his in-depth look: ""The best MK8 tracks combine challenging sets of fast corners with extended anti-gravity sections, multiple viable routes, and track hazards.
""Most of the new tracks are sedate in comparison, with laid-back layouts, less interesting track features, and little in the way of vehicle transformations.
""Simply porting mobile tracks over without major modifications means they don't match the gameplay concepts in Mario Kart 8 especially well.""
Following the recent release of the second wave, in the conclusion of his review, Ollie Reynolds from Nintendo Life said: ""Ultimately, Wave 2 Of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe doesn't quite knock it out of the park. 
""We know we've been bashing these courses left, right, and centre, but when it comes to Mario Kart, we have pretty high standards, you know. However, none of the tracks on offer are straight-up bad; most of them just feel like 'b-side' filler when compared to the main tracks created specifically for Mario Kart 8.""
""We have to keep reminding ourselves of the bigger picture, too; we've now got 16 new courses for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and we're not even halfway through yet. We've still got a ways to go.""
With new courses releasing periodically until the end of 2023, a sequel to the bestselling game in the series so far before then is unlikely.
Nintendo declined to comment on this article.
WATCH: Mixed-reality Mario Karts race around the home
Other than Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit, an augmented reality game where a radio-controlled toy car races around the player's house while streaming video from the onboard cameras directly into the video game, there hasn't been an original release title since 2014 - with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe essentially an enhanced Nintendo Switch update of the original Mario Kart 8 title on the Wii U. 
Another highly successful game, Grand Theft Auto Five, didn't get an official sequel throughout the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One era, essentially skipping a generation and it looks as though Nintendo might do the same with the Switch and Mario Kart 8. 
However, both developers will feel as though their games have received sufficient improvements to keep them fresh. Mario Kart 8's initial upgrade to Deluxe featured various additions, including a further five playable characters and now the subsequent DLC release.
With both GTA 5 and Mario Kart 8 in the top 10 best-selling video games of all time and a GTA 5 release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X earlier this year, they continue to generate a significant amount of revenue - so perhaps it's no surprise that neither Rockstar nor Nintendo have been in a rush to release sequels.  
In terms of an eventual follow-up to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Toto predicts gamers may have to wait until the release of the Switch's successor. 
""It's hard to say but if I had to, I think there would be some distance to Mario Kart 8, maybe 2024, something like that,"" he says.
""But I think, if Mario Kart 9 comes out with a new Switch console, I think they will launch it as a launch title, or very close to launch."" 
However, any new game in such a popular series will look to bring fresh ideas to the table - something Nintendo have been able to do so far, but Toto feels one of their biggest challenges is to keep delivering moving forward.
""Mario Kart 8 is so well made, that it might even be a victim of its own success,"" he explains.
""I heard that apparently, Nintendo came up with a new idea for Mario Kart 9. I think that they need a little bit of a reboot for Mario Kart 9. I'm not saying that Nintendo is rebooting the series, but what I'm trying to say is, I think they need a new angle for the series.""
""I think that Mario Kart 9 actually has to offer something new because just a rehash of Mario Kart 8 is probably not going to cut it for Nintendo."""
technology	Attacks on politicians whipped up by abuse, MP Charlotte Nichols says	"A Labour MP who has been physically assaulted and had someone come to her office armed with a knife has said she believes much of what she has faced ""has been whipped up by things online"".
Warrington North's Charlotte Nichols said ""clear laws"" were needed to deal with ""online harassment"".
A BBC investigation found MPs received thousands of abusive tweets.
Fellow MP Angela Rayner, who has had death threats, said there was ""no excuse"" for online abuse.
uty Labour leader, who represents Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester, said she agreed with what Ms Nichols had said and it was her experience that online abuse ""comes in waves"".
BBC analysis of three million tweets aimed at MPs over a six-week period found more than 130,000, about one in 20, could be classed as toxic.
Ms Nichols received more than 11,000 messages in the period, 8.3% of which were found to be toxic, while 4% of the 83,000 tweets Ms Rayner was sent were abusive.
Other North-West MPs had similar percentages, with 4.5% of the messages sent to Ribble Valley's Conservative representative Nigel Evans being abusive, 4.3% of those sent to both Labour's Andrew Gwynne and Alison McGovern, who represent Denton and Reddish and Wirral South, and 4.8% of those sent to Angela Eagle, the Labour MP for Wallasey.
Ms Nichols told BBC North West Tonight that she believed the online abuse had led to consequences in real life. 
""I've had someone come to my office with a knife before [and] I've had physical violence against me,"" she said, adding she had stepped up security at both her home and her office.
""A lot of that has been whipped up by things that have been online.""
She said that there was a ""need to have clear laws, particularly around online harassment"", but added that politicians had to lead by example.
""I think ultimately that all of us in some form of public life, whether it's in the council chamber or the chamber in Westminster, need to be modelling a good kind of debate that is based on policies and not on personal attacks,"" she said.
Ms Nichols has previously spoken about how she has been targeted since winning her seat at the 2019 general election.
She said at the time that she was ""horrified"" by the ""extent and severity"" of anti-Semitic and homophobic abuse she had received both online and in the post.
Ms Rayner said she had received repeated abuse, including ""very derogatory language"", sexist remarks, threats against her children and being called ""stupid and thick"" because of her Manchester accent.
She said there was ""no excuse or no place"" for such comments in political debate and they caused ""significant harm"".
""These comments about my personal attributes and who I am as an individual, as opposed to policy, are the things that really worry me,"" she added.
witter has previously said it is committed to combatting abuse as outlined in its Hateful Conduct Policy.
mpany has also previously pointed out it has a much more open platform than other social media companies, which allows researchers to ""enhance and research the public conversation"".

V screen time for 16 to 24-year-olds was on average one hour and six minutes.
But the older generation spent nearly half their waking day in front of the TV - at six hours.
""The streaming revolution is stretching the TV generation gap,"" said Ofcom's Director for Wales, Eleanor Marks.

""Traditional broadcasters face tough competition, which they've partly met through the popularity of their own on-demand player apps. 
""Combined viewing to the main five Public Service Broadcasting (PBS) channels continues to account for more than half of broadcast TV viewing in Wales.""
report also found TV users in Wales were more likely than the UK average to have a connected TV.
Covid-19 restrictions in Wales were thought to be the main drivers for the increase in screen time in 2020 - when people spent five hours and six minutes on average watching TV and video content per day. 
figure fell by 33 minutes in 2021. 
Growth was also seen in video-on-demand services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+.
Ofcom said about a fifth homes in the UK subscribed to all three of the most popular platforms. 
And in Wales, they proved increasingly popular with 70% of households signing up to at least one - up from 64% in 2021.
report noted nine in 10 people aged 18 to 24 bypassed TV channels and headed straight to streaming, on-demand and social video services when looking for something to watch.
Meanwhile 59% of 55 to 64-year-olds still enjoyed a flick through the channels first.
In 2021, nine in 10 adults listened to the radio in Wales for an average of 22 hours each week, with BBC network radio stations continuing to have the largest market share.
Wales also appeared to be leading the way in old-fashioned listening habits. 
Listening to live radio on a radio set was higher for adults in Wales, at 74%, compared with 65% of adults in Great Britain.
But weekly reach of music streaming and online radio was lower than average.

technology	YouTube joins Facebook in banning Andrew Tate	"YouTube has banned influencer Andrew Tate for violating its policies.
Google-owned social media site took action following Meta's decision to ban Mr Tate from Facebook and Instagram.
former kickboxer rose to fame in 2016 when he was removed from TV show Big Brother over a video which appeared to depict him attacking a woman.
He went on to gain notoriety online - with Twitter banning him for saying women should ""bear responsibility"" for being sexually assaulted.
At the time of his removal from Big Brother, in 2016, Mr Tate said the controversial video had been edited, calling it ""a total lie trying to make me look bad"". 
Google, which owns YouTube, told the BBC: ""We terminated channels associated with Andrew Tate for multiple violations of our Community Guidelines and Terms of Service, including our hate speech policy. 
""If a channel is terminated, the uploader is unable to use, own or create any other YouTube channels.""
Mr Tate's YouTube channels had more than a million followers between them.
kTok has also banned an account belonging to Mr Tate as part of an ongoing investigation to remove content that violates its policies.
A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC: ""Misogyny is a hateful ideology that is not tolerated on TikTok.
""We've been removing violative videos and accounts for weeks, and we welcome the news that other platforms are also taking action against this individual.""
On Instagram, Tate had 4.7 million followers at the time his account was removed. That number had grown rapidly from around one million followers in June.
Meta said it had removed the kickboxing star from its platforms for violating its policies on dangerous organisations and individuals, but did not provide further details.
BBC has approached Mr Tate for comment.
By Marianna Spring, disinformation and social media correspondent
Andrew Tate's videos - promoting misogyny and targeting women - have come to prominence this summer, with many teens commenting on just how much he's appearing on their social media feeds. 
His content has raised concerns about the real-world effect it could have, especially on the younger users exposed to it during their school holidays when they have time on their hands.
focus has been primarily on TikTok, where users say they've been readily served up his videos - sparking a new wave of videos commenting on and criticising Mr Tate's content. 
YouTube has also found itself under pressure, since it's where he has racked up millions of views.
I revealed how social media sites promote anti-women hate for BBC Panorama. The investigations exposed how some platforms' algorithms were recommending more and more misogyny to a troll account. 
Since then, several sites have made commitments to better protect female users. But, once again, questions are being raised about the role social media sites play in pushing anti-women content. 
Mr Tate has drawn criticism online for his comments, particularly from UK advocacy group Hope Not Hate, which welcomed Meta's ban last week.
Joe Mulhall, director of research at the group, said Mr Tate ""poses a genuine threat to young men, radicalising them towards extremism misogyny, racism and homophobia"".
He added: ""We've provided significant evidence to the major social media platforms, including Meta, about his activity and why he must be removed.""
Videos about Mr Tate have proved popular across social media platforms, particularly on TikTok where videos using the #AndrewTate hashtag have been viewed more than 12.7 billion times.
But this number represents not just videos of Tate and his supporters - it also includes videos made by people criticising the influencer.
On YouTube, some of his most popular videos have had millions of views.
In one video, during which he was interviewed by another YouTuber, he said he was ""absolutely a misogynist"", adding: ""I'm a realist and when you're a realist you're sexist. There's no way you can be rooted in reality and not be sexist.""
Later in the same video he called women ""intrinsically lazy"" and said there was ""no such thing as an independent female"".
In a different video, Mr Tate said: ""If I have responsibility over her, then I must have a degree of authority.""
He added: ""You can't be responsible for a dog if it doesn't obey you."""
technology	AI tools fail to reduce recruitment bias - study	"Artificially intelligent hiring tools do not reduce bias or improve diversity, researchers say in a study.
""There is growing interest in new ways of solving problems such as interview bias,"" the Cambridge University researchers say, in the journal Philosophy and Technology
use of AI is becoming widespread - but its analysis of candidate videos or applications is ""pseudoscience"". 
A professional body for human resources told BBC News AI could counter bias.
In 2020, the study notes, an international survey of 500 human-resources professionals suggested nearly a quarter were using AI for ""talent acquisition, in the form of automation"".
But using it to reduce bias is counter-productive and, University of Cambridge's Centre for Gender Studies post-doctoral researcher Dr Kerry Mackereth told BBC News, based on ""a myth"".
""These tools can't be trained to only identify job-related characteristics and strip out gender and race from the hiring process, because the kinds of attributes we think are essential for being a good employee are inherently bound up with gender and race,"" she said.
Some companies have also found these tools problematic, the study notes.
In 2018, for example, Amazon announced it had scrapped the development of an AI-powered recruitment engine because it could detect gender from CVs and discriminated against female applicants.
Of particular concern to the researchers were tools to ""analyse the minutiae of a candidate's speech and bodily movements"" to see how closely they resembled a company's supposed ideal employee.
Video and image analysis technology had ""no scientific basis"", co-author Dr Eleanor Drage told BBC News, dismissing it as ""modern phrenology"", the false theory skull shape could reveal character and mental faculties.
""They say that they can know your personality from looking at your face. The idea is that, like a lie-detector test, AI can see 'through' your face to the real you,"" she told BBC News.
With six computer-science students, the researchers built their own simplified AI recruitment tool, to rate candidates' photographs for the ""big five"" personality traits: 
But the ratings were skewed by many irrelevant variables.
""When you use our tool, you can see that your personality score changes when you alter the contrast/brightness/saturation,"" Dr Drage wrote.
gy news site The Register noted other investigations had reached a similar conclusion. 
A German public broadcaster found wearing glasses or a headscarf in a video changed a candidate's scores.
Hayfa Mohdzaini, from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, told BBC News its research suggested only 8% of employers used AI to select candidates.
""AI can efficiently help increase an organisation's diversity by filtering from a larger candidate pool - but it can also miss out on lots of good candidates if the rules and training data are incomplete or inaccurate,"" she said.
""AI software to analyse candidates' voice and body language in recruitment is in its infancy and therefore carries both opportunities and risks."" "
technology	Teens shun traditional news channels for TikTok and Instagram, Ofcom says	"More teenagers are turning away from traditional media outlets and getting their news from social media, new research from Ofcom has shown.
umber of people consuming news content on TikTok has increased from 800,000 in 2020 to 3.9 million in 2022.
For the first time, Instagram is the most popular news source among younger people - used by 29% of teens in 2022 - with TikTok and YouTube close behind.
But print, TV and radio news outlets still dominate in older age groups.
growth in news consumed via TikTok is being driven mainly by younger age groups - half of users consuming news on the platform are aged 16-24.
umber of people consuming news via the video sharing platform is now similar to the number using the Sky News website and app, Ofcom said.
kTok users who took part in the study said they get more of their news from ""other people they follow"" (47%) than from news organisations' own accounts (24%).
Increasingly, news stories also originate on the platform. Earlier this week, a video showing a student being harassed by a man on a Cardiff street was watched more than two million times and picked up by news outlets.
And the recent high-profile libel case between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp dominated the video sharing platform, with many users watching the proceedings unfold live on YouTube before selecting clips to share with their followers on TikTok.
Yih-Choung Teh, Ofcom's group director for strategy and research, said in a statement that teenagers nowadays are ""increasingly unlikely to pick up a newspaper or tune into TV news"", preferring to stay informed by ""scrolling through their social feeds"". 
""And while youngsters find news on social media to be less reliable, they rate these services more highly for serving up a range of opinions on the day's topical stories,"" he added.
Despite its newfound popularity though, less than a third of young people (30%) asked in the study said they actually trusted the news content they found through TikTok.
On Instagram, the BBC was the most followed outlet for users who consume news on the platform, with a 45% reach. Sky News (22%), the Lad Bible and Buzzfeed (both14%) also performed well on the platform. 
Around 60% of Instagram users who consume news said they followed a public figure, while 44% said they followed at least one specific journalist.
gers are using Instagram and TikTok for news is probably not a surprise. It was perhaps more surprising that, right up until 2020, BBC One remained their number one source of news and still remains top of the list for ""most important source"". The research shows 59% say they still watch some news on TV.  
However, for anyone interested in which news sources are most influential, this new research makes interesting reading.
f printed newspapers has been apparent for many years, but the drop in the last two years has been startling. In 2020, 35% of the population (the vast majority over the age of 55) were still reading a paper, but that's now dropped to 24% - a drop of almost a third.
It appears deliveries and popping out for a paper are some of the former daily habits which were disrupted by Covid. 
And for those hoping digital readership was replacing print, it's not good news. Online reach for newspaper websites also dropped slightly (from 20% to 19% of the population). 
However, it's worth noting that this misses out a crucial part of the news landscape. The news agenda is still, in many ways, driven by what appears on front pages and news websites.
Instagram and TikTok are popular platforms for news, but the stories themselves often have their origins in what used to be called Fleet Street. 
And what's easily forgotten is that the biggest source of news for teens isn't Instagram but their families (65%), and mum or dad are probably not relying on TikTok just yet.
Ofcom report also shows an acceleration in the decline in consumption of traditional outlets, particularly among young people.
BBC One and BBC Two, previously the most popular news sources among teenagers, have been knocked off the top spot and are now down in fifth place.
Just under a quarter (24%) of those asked used the those channels to find news last year, compared with almost half (45%) five years ago.
For adults in the UK the picture is a little different however, as BBC One remains the most used news source.
A BBC spokesman said: ""According to this Ofcom research the BBC is the most used news source for 12-15 year olds - via TV, radio, and online - and young people are also consuming BBC News on social media platforms such as our hugely popular Instagram account.""
V news generally remains the most trusted source among most (71%) adults, with news on social media deemed to be the least reliable (35%).
CNN (83%) was found to be the most trusted of the all the news channels, with Sky News (75%) in second place and the BBC (73%) in third, followed closely by ITV (70%).
Sixty-seven percent of newcomer GB News's viewers said they trusted its reporting.
re is still a trend for traditional networks like BBC, ITV and Sky News being in general decline in terms of overall viewing figures, which are now below pre-pandemic levels.
Readership of print and online newspapers among adults (38%) also declined again this year, the study suggested, with a significant decrease from 2020 (47%) and 2018 (51%).
When the newspapers' online presence was removed, those consuming news solely from physical papers also declined from 35% in 2020 to 24% in 2022.
use of newspapers among teenagers fell from 19% to 13% in the past five years."

technology	Canadian admits to hacking spree with Russian cyber-gang	"An ex-Canadian government IT worker has admitted to being a high-level hacker with a Russian cyber-crime group.
Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, from Quebec, Canada, has agreed to plead guilty in a Florida court.
34-year-old was affiliated to the NetWalker ransomware crew, which has attacked companies, municipalities, hospitals, schools and universities.
When he was arrested, police discovered he was in possession of $27m (£22.2m) in Bitcoin.
represents a rare example of a successful arrest and prosecution of a hacker working for a Russia-based cyber-crime group.
US court documents state that the Canadian was one of NetWalker's most prolific affiliates.
Evidence gathered by police shows he went on a hacking spree between April and December 2020, attacking 17 Canadian companies and many others around the world. 
NetWalker operated a ransomware-as-a-service criminal business, offering its malicious software and extortion website to hacker affiliates. 
rs, who are still at large, communicate in Russian online and ensure that their malware does not infect Russian computer systems, or those of former Soviet countries which are now members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
Affiliates like Mr Vachon-Desjardins are responsible for identifying and attacking high-value victims with the ransomware.
NetWalker developers and affiliates split the ransom or, if the victim refuses to pay, a share of the money made from selling the stolen data.
Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work?
Mr Vachon-Desjardins was arrested in Canada in January 2021 and subsequently extradited following a US investigation into the cyber-crime group, which dismantled its online operation and uncovered a database of affiliate details.
It revealed the NetWalker group had roughly 100 members, including affiliates, who extorted at least $40m from victims.
In one incident, the group extorted $1.14m from a US university trying to develop a Covid-19 vaccine. 
A NetWalker attack on the Düsseldorf University Clinic in September 2020 is also believed to have contributed to the death of a patient who had to be relocated to another hospital for treatment.
In each incident the victims would find a note on their computers reading: ""Hi! Your files are encrypted by NetWalker. 
""Our encryption algorithms are very strong and your files are very well protected, the only way to get your files back is to co-operate with us and get the decrypter program. For us this is just business.""
Police seized dozens of computers and storage devices, 719 Bitcoin worth approximately C$35m ($27m, £22m) and C$790,000 in cash from Mr Vachon-Desjardins' house. 
ker is a former IT consultant for Canada's public works and government services department. 
On his LinkedIn profile, he says he worked for various government departments from 2010 onwards, and cites expertise in responding to cyber-security incidents.
He is pleading guilty to one count of conspiring to commit computer fraud, and one count of transmitting a demand in relation to damaging a protected computer. 
urt has agreed not to proceed with two other charges.
He will be sentenced at a later date, and could face 10 years in prison. "

technology	FTX woes: 'I'm waiting to get £2,000 back from crypto giant'	"FTX users have described feeling ""hopeful"" after withdrawals on the cryptocurrency exchange have appeared to restart.
mas Culham, 22, told the BBC that he had lodged a withdrawal request for £2,000.
Bitcoin touched a two-year low after the Binance pulled out of a deal to rescue its smaller rival, FTX.
xchange, used to buy and sell digital tokens, is still advising customers not to make deposits.
According to Coindesk and reports from users on social media, the troubled platform has allowed some customers to withdraw funds for the first time in days.
mas, a 22-year-old from Kingston, has been an FTX customer for more than a year, and describes it as a ""hub for crypto"".
He says he was able to lodge a withdrawal request for £2,000 he held on the exchange, which he describes as a ""really significant amount of money"".
But he says he has concerns around the volume of requests made by FTX customers, and is not sure whether or not they will all be serviced as the company battles on.
On Thursday, Bitcoin fell below $16,000 (£14,049) for the first time since 2020. Investor confidence was hit by the news that Binance had scrapped its deal to buy FTX, citing concerns over due diligence.
re are also fears of further crypto market volatility if FTX goes bust.
Concerns about the company's financial health reportedly triggered $6bn (£5.2bn) of withdrawals in just three days.
""I thought FTX was safe"", another customer told the BBC earlier on Thursday.
""I've got about $3,000 (£2,630) worth of coins in my own crypto wallet but more worrying is that I invested $33,000 (£28,900) for my mum and stepdad through the app. I don't yet have the heart to tell them what's happened.""
Binance said reports of ""mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations"" had swayed its decision not to buy FTX. 
Reuters news agency reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was investigating FTX's handling of customer funds and its crypto-lending activities.
markets regulator is also examining whether the platform has broken laws with regards to how it has handled customer assets.
Binance said in a statement posted on Twitter that the issues facing FTX were ""beyond our control or ability to help"".
""Every time a major player in an industry fails, retail consumers will suffer. We have seen over the last several years that the crypto ecosystem is becoming more resilient and we believe in time that outliers that misuse user funds will be weeded out by the free market.""
FTX's founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance's chief executive Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao are two of the most powerful people in the cryptocurrency market and high-profile rivals.
ressure on FTX came in part from Mr Zhao, who had tweeted on Sunday that Binance would sell its holdings of FTX's digital token, known as FTT. The token has lost around 90% of its value this week.
Binance stepped in on Tuesday, saying it had signed a letter of intent to buy FTX's non-US unit. But it added it had ""the discretion to pull out from the deal at any time"".
Mr Zhao tweeted on Wednesday: ""Sad day. Tried, but [crying emoji]"".
As well as Bitcoin dropping on the news, shares in the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase fell by more than 9.5%.
Meanwhile, venture capital firm Sequoia Capital said it will completely write off its more than $210m investment in FTX, as the cryptocurrency exchange is at risk of bankruptcy.
""Based on our current understanding, we are marking our investment down to $0,"" the company said in a statement posted on Twitter.
April Joyner, a correspondent at Business Insider in New York, told the BBC's Today programme the problems at FTX could be quite serious.
""If FTX were to go under a lot of people could potentially lose their money depending on what's going on there,"" she said.
A notice on its website still reads: ""FTX is currently unable to process withdrawals. We strongly advise against depositing.""
FTX was approached by BBC News for comment.
""It's also led to a lot of turmoil on crypto markets - we've seen prices of Bitcoin, Etherium etc fall and so there's a lot of distress and worries about the crypto markets right now,"" Ms Joyner added.
Ms Joyner said the ""different players"" in cryptocurrency firms were ""very enmeshed"" with each other which meant ""if one entity has some sort of weakness it can bring down a lot of other players"".
re is a growing list of cryptocurrency businesses that have failed because of a lack of cash reserves.
Adding to the pressure, the SEC and other regulators have been ratcheting up scrutiny of the industry as concerns grow about how crypto platforms are trading.
Earlier this year, a subsidiary of crypto firm BlockFi agreed to pay a record penalty to settle charges related to its retail lending product."
technology	Raksha Bandhan to Laal Singh Chaddha: 'Struggling' Bollywood's online hate problem	"wo of India's biggest Bollywood stars have been facing social media calls to boycott their upcoming movies - but do such campaigns actually have any effect?
Laal Singh Chaddha and Raksha Bandhan, starring Aamir Khan and Akshay Kumar, respectively, have been trending this week on social media amid demands by a section of users to boycott the films, the actors and even Bollywood itself. Both movies are set to release in theatres on 11 August.
media trends seem to reflect the changing relationship between Bollywood - India's Hindi-language film industry which employs millions of people - and its audience, but experts say it's difficult to measure how much damage such calls can wreak.
Bollywood is yet to recover from the massive losses it incurred when theatres were shut for months during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Even after they reopened, several big-budget movies have failed at the box-office, leading some pundits to predict that the industry is staring at a major crisis. Adding to this is the massive success of a handful of films from southern Indian states which have scored even with Hindi-speaking audiences.
So there's a lot of hope and money riding on Laal Singh Chaddha - an official adaptation of Tom Hanks-starrer Forrest Gump - and Raksha Bandhan, in which Kumar plays a devoted big brother to four sisters. 
But right-wingers online have raked up old remarks made by the stars or others associated with the movies to accuse them of being ""anti-India"" or against Hindus.
Khan has had to defend himself and publicly affirm that he loves India after some people pointed to a 2015 remark expressing alarm over religious intolerance. 
remarks were widely seen as pointing to rising attacks on minorities after 2014, when a government led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power. After the comments caused a controversy, Khan has often said that his words were taken out of context.
week, the actor said he was ""sad"" that people seemed to truly believe he did not like India. ""I want to assure everyone that it's not the case so please don't boycott my films,"" he told the media.
It's harder to pinpoint exactly what's driving the opposition to Raksha Bandhan - Kumar is one of India's most bankable stars who has made a slew of films that appeal to Hindu nationalists. But many social media posts have criticised the film's screenwriter for criticising lynching by cow vigilantes; others have pointed to Kumar's tweet on milk being wasted in temple rituals and a 2012 film which criticises religious charlatans.
""It's true there's been a marked increase in calls to 'blacklist' online,"" says film critic Uday Bhatia. ""These are almost never organic, and often push a right-wing agenda.""  
Campaigns like these, Mr Bhatia points out, ""usually revolve around some imagined hurt to public sentiments that the film or the actor is causing"".
ronic because, as he adds, Hindi films ""go out of their way to appease their audience"". 
One of the year's biggest hits was a small-budget movie called The Kashmir Files, which polarised viewers with its treatment of the exodus of Hindus from Kashmir in the 1990s.
""Nationalism, Hindu honour, historical Hindu icons, Hindu suffering in the past and contemporary military strength have all become popular subjects for filmmakers in Bollywood,"" critic Sowmya Rajendra wrote recently.
Over the past few years, India's entertainment industry has also seen a divide between supporters and critics of the BJP's Hindu right-wing ideology.
Most big Bollywood stars prefer to keep their political opinions to themselves, fearing a backlash. Filmmakers who handle controversial subjects often face massive trolling campaigns and sometimes even police cases. 
Added to this was a campaign - triggered by the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in 2020 - that sought to brand all of Bollywood as a nepotism-driven industry that punished talented outsiders. While there was some measure of truth to this, supporters pointed out that these challenges permeated across sectors, not just the film industry.
ffect of social media trolling and the toll it takes on people in the film industry has been a recurring topic of discussion on the latest season of the popular talk show Koffee with Karan.
""We as an industry were vilified. We were put in the dungeon for two years,"" producer-director Karan Johar, who hosts the show, said in one of the episodes. 
But while people in the industry have become more and more careful about their public image, experts say boycott calls may not affect box office results too much.
""True public opinion about industry folk is rarely reflected. Akshay Kumar is probably the most popular Hindi film star today, yet calls to boycott his film Raksha Bandhan were recently trending,"" Mr Bhatia says.
rade analyst Taran Adarsh points to the success of films such as Dangal - starring and produced by Khan - and Padmaavat, which faced massive right-wing protests.
""Everyone has become very cautious. But to understand whether or not [social media trolling] affects a film, you have to wait till its release. The audience response will tell you,"" he says.
Negative campaigns, Mr Adarsh says, make these films a talking point and whip up emotion before the public has even seen the film.
""But at the end of the day, if the audience loves a film, there is no stopping it,"" he says. 
While every Bollywood success can't be attributed to ""good content"", Mr Bhatia feels that the viewer remains king for now - ""not the troll"".
But with online spaces only becoming more toxic, it's unlikely that Bollywood's troubled relationship with social media will heal anytime soon.

technology	Why lasers are being used to write inside diamonds	"I am peering through a jeweller's eyeglass, looking for the BBC logo that has been inscribed inside a small diamond.
ription has been made using unique technology developed by Oxford-based Opsydia.
Its machines are the only ones on the market that can penetrate the surface of a diamond and manipulate its atoms.
go I am trying to find is less than half a millimetre wide. Despite instruction from Lewis Fish, head of product at Opsydia, I can't see it.
""It is very difficult,"" he says. ""They're intentionally very fine, and it is really trained jewellers they are aimed at."" 
But why would anyone want to write on the inside of a diamond? 
""The big thing that's happening in the industry is traceability and transparency,"" says Andrew Rimmer, the chief executive of Opsydia.
He believes that Opsydia's technology can improve on the existing ways that diamonds are identified.
re are already systems for tracking a diamond, from when it first emerges from a mine as a rough diamond, through the cutting and polishing phase and on to the retailer.
But the process is far from perfect. Last year, Human Rights Watch (HRW) criticised jewellers, saying many could not identify the mines of origin for their diamonds.
mportant, according to HRW, because ""labour rights violations, violence, and other abuses have remained a serious problem in gold and diamond mining"".
More technology of business:
It is also becoming crucial for diamond sellers to be able to distinguish between those that have come from mines, known as natural diamonds, and the growing number of diamonds produced by machines, known as lab-grown diamonds.
gy for producing lab-grown diamonds is improving all the time, and they are a fast-growing section of the market.
But natural diamonds are considerably more expensive than lab-grown gems, so it is important to have a reliable way of telling them apart.
Mr Rimmer explains that his systems can provide that failsafe verification, by inscribing data inside the diamond - data that is impossible to remove, but does not devalue the gem in any way.
""People who are making diamond jewellery, they want to be able to show to the consumer this is a natural diamond and from an ethical source,"" says Mr Rimmer.
Opsydia's diamond-inscribing machine is the size of a very large photocopier. Inside is a pulsed laser that emits very short laser bursts. 
Such high-powered bursts can accurately manipulate materials like diamonds and other gems at very small scales.
However, just pointing the laser at a diamond is not enough - the diamond's structure would scatter the beam.
""Diamond is about the most difficult material out of the transparent materials to process with lasers,"" says Mr Rimmer.
Opsydia's system tunes the laser so that it can pass through the surface of the diamond, usually to a depth of about a quarter of a millimetre.
Instead of randomly bouncing around the diamond, the laser comes to a pinpoint focus to create the inscription to suit the client's need.
If the diamond needs an identification number which is invisible to anyone without powerful microscopes, then the system can alter the diamond at the molecular level.
However, if a jeweller wants its logo to be visible then the laser can be used to make bigger changes to the carbon structure of the diamond.
At the moment Opsydia can assemble only a small number of the £400,000 ($480,000) machines at a time. But it is expanding its operation and expects soon to be selling dozens of the machines a year.
Mr Rimmer is optimistic that the laser technology will have other applications too.
r can make atomic-scale changes to create circuitry inside the diamond. That could be useful for making instruments for radiation detection, where a diamond's durability is also an asset.
Potentially such circuitry could also be used in quantum computers - machines that can perform complex calculations in a fraction of the time taken by existing devices.
Quantum computers work by exploiting the weird quantum properties of individual particles. They are hard to build and are still in their early stages, but diamonds offer a promising way to isolate and use the quantum properties of nitrogen atoms. 
More technology of business:
But for now, Opsydia is focused on the diamond verification business, and that is a good place to be, according to Edahn Golan, an Israel-based consultant to the diamond industry.
""There's a growing movement to track diamonds in an impartial way,"" he says. 
""At this point, none of the systems are perfect, because nothing is implemented fully from the mine to the store.""
gital ledger technology, blockchain, will become more widespread in the jewellery industry, according to Mr Golan.
He says the verification methods are going to evolve as miners are keen to distinguish their diamonds from those made in factories and consumers want to know their jewellery is ethically sourced.
""If I walk into your jewellery store on Main Street USA and ask: 'Can you guarantee that this particular diamond that you're offering me is ethical?' - and you blink - you have a problem,"" he says."
technology	Ofcom report shows growing 5G coverage	"About seven in 10 UK properties can now get 5G reception from at least one mobile operator, says a new report from media regulator Ofcom.
up from about half of all UK households 12 months ago, the Connected Nations report said.
umber of mobile phones able to use 5G has also risen significantly, doubling in the past year to one in five handsets, the Ofcom report found.
But some consumers say the connection speed is disappointing.
5G has received lots of investment from the mobile operators and government and is hailed as a faster, more reliable connection.
re are about 12,000 5G mobile sites now in the UK, almost double last year's figure: 86% of those are in England, 8% in Scotland, 4% in Wales and 2% in Northern Ireland.
Mark Jackson, of ISPreview.co.uk, told the BBC that 5G rollout has been ""slowed a bit"" by the government's decision to order networks to remove technology from Huawei by 2027, which ""caused engineers at most of the operators to focus on removing and replacing related 4G and 5G kit"".
5G traffic - the amount of voice and data flowing over the network - has trebled over the past 12 months and now corresponds to nearly 10% of all mobile traffic.   
A BBC report heard from a number of people who were disappointed with the performance of 5G they experienced.
Ofcom analysed crowdsourced data from Opensignal to help judge the quality of service across the UK. 
It found for 5G devices many more areas achieve a ""high performance"" level than for non-5G devices, but found that - even for 5G - few areas met the ""highest performance"" level. 
Ofcom told the BBC it wanted to see investment in 5G networks. 
It said ""The UK's mobile companies are still in the process of rolling out 5G and are at different stages of extending their networks. So customers' experience will vary by their location and network.
""We'll be taking further steps over the coming year to shine a light on this, so people can see for themselves which operators are leading the way for quality of service."" 
me report found more than 12 million households - 42% of UK homes - now have the option to get a full-fibre broadband connection, an increase of 4.3 million from last year.
Full-fibre connections and upgraded cable networks can deliver download speeds of one gigabit per second (Gbit/s) or higher - fast enough to download an HD movie in under a minute.
report found 70% of UK homes could receive a Gigabit-capable connection. Last year they were available in less than half the UK. 
But only about 25% of households are taking up these faster connections, according to Ofcom.
Mr Jackson said after recent ""dramatic"" improvements in coverage, largely on the basis of private sector investment, he expected ""gigabit coverage to grow more slowly"".
Nearly 80,000 homes and businesses do not have access to ""decent"" broadband, defined as offering download speeds of 10 Mbit/s the report notes. That is fast enough to stream an HD film or game, but will run into problems if more than one person tries to stream at once.
figure has fallen from 123,000 last year, with Ofcom acknowledging that many of those still without ""decent"" broadband are in the hardest-to-reach parts of the UK. 
regulator said it estimates that a further 15,000 properties will be covered by publicly-funded broadband schemes going ahead in the coming 12 months.
government recently announced plans for a trial of Elon Musk's Starlink system to provide broadband to some of the most inaccessible locations in the UK. Starlink uses a constellation of thousands of low Earth orbit satellites to deliver a broadband connection.
f Starlink surprised some commentators, as the government owns a stake in another rival broadband-via-satellite firm, OneWeb.
government told the BBC it was down to ""the readiness and availability"" of Starlink's technology. 
Department for Culture, Media and Sport said it continued to discuss ""other solutions and services"" with suppliers, ""including OneWeb, at more complex sites""."
technology	Sharing pornographic deepfakes to be illegal in England and Wales	"A planned new law would make sharing pornographic deepfakes without consent a crime in England and Wales.
kling the rise in manipulated images, where a person's face is put on someone else's body, is part of a crackdown on the abuse of intimate pictures in the Online Safety Bill.
w would also make it easier to charge people with sharing intimate photos without consent.
Prosecutors would no longer need to prove they intended to cause distress.
In some cases under the existing law, men have admitted sharing women's intimate images without consent, but have not been prosecuted because they said they did not intend to cause any harm.
government says around one in 14 adults in England and Wales say they have been threatened with their intimate images being shared against their will. 
It also says there are growing global concerns about technology being used to create fake pornographic images and video, with one website which creates nude images from clothed ones receiving 38 million visits last year.
In August, BBC Panorama exposed a network of men on the social media site Reddit who traded women's nudes online - including some which had been faked - as well as harassing and threatening the women.
Law Commission said reporting such as this, along with campaigners' calls for stronger laws, helped to make a ""compelling case"" to government for reform.
It outlined recommendations earlier this year to ensure all examples of deliberately taking or sharing intimate images without consent are illegal.
government said some of these - including specific laws against ""downblousing"", installing hidden cameras, and threatening to share someone's intimate images - would be dealt with in future legislation, but it did not offer any timescale.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had promised to criminalise downblousing, a term for taking photos down a woman's top without her consent, in this summer's Tory leadership contest. The move would bring it in line with an earlier law against ""upskirting"".
Announcing the measures, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the government accepted there were gaps in the law and it needed to adapt to the changing use of technology.
He said he wanted to ""give women and girls the confidence that the justice system is on their side and will really come down like a ton of bricks on those who abuse or intimidate them"".
Ayesha - not her real name - told Panorama in August how videos secretly filmed by a partner and faked images of her were being shared on Reddit, driving her to try to take her own life.
She told the BBC that the new announcement gave her hope that police could take action and the harassment she experienced would finally end.
""It will make a massive change to my life and to many other lives as well. We'll be actually able to live and to breathe in peace without having to be scared,"" she said.
Kate Isaacs, who told a BBC documentary last month how she was targeted by deepfake creators after campaigning against non-consensual porn, says tackling the issue requires more than a change in the law.
""I think it's deeply rooted in society at this point. We don't have time. The technology is running 1,000 miles quicker than we are,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday.
She said even for an seasoned campaigner on this issue, having her own image and her identity violated by deepfakers had been a frightening experience.
""I had given advice to so many survivors on what you should do if you become a victim of this crime. But I just froze, and didn't follow any of my own advice. I think it was just too scary to comprehend and process at the time,"" she said.
Georgie has been campaigning to change the law around intimate image abuse
One deepfake porn creator told the BBC earlier this year that the risk of prosecution could make him stop.
""If I could be traced online I would stop there and probably find another hobby,"" he said.
Ministry of Justice also said it was looking at whether it could give the victims of intimate image abuse the same anonymity as the victims of sexual offences are granted, in line with the Law Commission's recommendations.
Prof Clare McGlynn at Durham University, an expert in image-based sexual abuse, told the BBC the changes were ""a testament to the courage of women who have been speaking up"", but added that it was ""absolutely vital that anonymity is granted immediately"".
""Victims tell us that not being able to be anonymous means they are more reluctant to report to the police and it means cases are more often dropped,"" she said."
technology	Microsoft Activision deal could lessen competition, UK watchdog finds	"Microsoft's plan to buy Activision Blizzard could substantially lessen competition in consoles, multi-game subscription services and game streaming, a UK watchdog has said.
Microsoft wants to buy the maker of Overwatch, Candy Crush and Call of Duty for $68.7bn (£59.2bn).
But the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says its concerns mean it may now carry out an in-depth probe.
Microsoft said it was ready to work with the CMA on the ""next steps"".
If the deal goes through it will be the Xbox maker's largest ever acquisition.
games Activision Blizzard make are some of the most popular in the world. But it has previously faced accusations of permitting a toxic and sexist work-place culture.
In its ruling, the CMA said that it was concerned that if Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard it could harm rivals, ""by refusing them access to Activision Blizzard games or providing access on much worse terms"".
Sorcha O'Carroll, senior director of mergers at the CMA, said: ""Microsoft could use its control over popular games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft post-merger to harm rivals.
""If our current concerns are not addressed, we plan to explore this deal in an in-depth Phase 2 investigation to reach a decision that works in the interests of UK gamers and businesses."" 
marks the end of the CMA's initial investigation, Phase 1 as it is called. At Phase 2, the CMA appoints an independent panel to examine the deal in more depth.
If after that CMA finds that a merger is problematic it will take steps to remedy its bad effects. That could mean stopping the merger, or allowing it to proceed but only if certain conditions are met.
In response to the news Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement, ""We're ready to work with the CMA on next steps and address any of its concerns. 
""Sony, as the industry leader, says it is worried about Call of Duty, but we've said we are committed to making the same game available on the same day on both Xbox and PlayStation. We want people to have more access to games, not less."" 
Microsoft maintains that its principal interest in the planned acquisition is Activision Blizzard's expertise in mobile gaming.
firm's head of gaming, Phil Spencer, told Bloomberg that ""the biggest gaming platform on the planet is mobile phones"" an area in which Microsoft lacked expertise.
Currently Activision games can be played on both Xbox and rival PlayStation consoles, but the proposed takeover have led some to speculate that more games might become Xbox exclusives.
mething Mr Smith previously denied in an interview with CNBC, telling the network that ""Great titles like Call of Duty... will continue to be available on the Sony PlayStation"".
He drew parallels with the firm's 2014 acquisition of Minecraft where he said the company had invested in the game and brought it to more platforms.
was reiterated in a blog post by Phil Spencer published on Thursday.
Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard, an eye watering deal worth almost $70bn, shook the games industry.
wo are both absolute giants, and their merger would make them a behemoth.
US tech giant, which owns Xbox, has aggressive gaming ambitions and deep pockets. It owns 23 games studios, including Minecraft maker Mojang, and Bethesda, creator of Fallout and SkyRim.
Activision Blizzard's greatest hits include Call of Duty, Overwatch, Skylander and Diablo.
Sony - owner of the world's best-selling games console, the PlayStation - has said publicly that it ""expects"" Microsoft to keep these enormous titles multi-platform.
But Microsoft's Phil Spencer says what he's really interested in now is the mobile gaming market, and Activision also happens to own Candy Crush Saga - a simple, ten year old game which remains one of the most popular mobile games of all time.
It's no wonder that the competition regulators are now putting this deal even further under the microscope. They need to be certain that a merger of this size won't completely crush the market. 
Other countries, in addition to the UK, are carrying out their own anti-trust investigations - and last month Saudi Arabia became the first to approve the deal.
Some have pointed to previous takeovers for evidence that the deal might lead to more new Activision Blizzard games becoming exclusive to Microsoft owned platforms.
Last year, Microsoft successfully purchased the parent company of Fallout maker Bethesda Softworks for $7.5bn (£6.46bn).
At the time the Mr Spencer said, ""some new titles in the future that will be exclusive to Xbox and PC players"".
And in a tweet Xbox's Aaron Greenberg confirmed that Starfield, a game announced by Bethseda three years prior to the purchase in 2018, will not be released on PlayStation.
Some independent game-makers have also been worried they might be marginalised in Microsoft's Netflix-like game subscription service Game Pass if the deal went through, and the firm began favouring its own titles.
But Sony, which makes PlayStation, has also been acquiring studios, purchasing game-maker Bungie for $3.7bn in June."
technology	Driverless cars: Experts warn no easy answer to how safe they should be	"re is no easy answer as to how safe self-driving cars should be, an adviser to a new government-backed report has told the BBC.
report, from the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, warns that it might not be enough for self-driving cars to be safer than normal cars.
It says the public may have little tolerance for driverless car crashes - even if they are safer on average.
It comes as the government sets out its plans for self-driving cars. 
No self-driving cars are currently allowed on UK roads, but the government has now said the first such vehicles could be on UK roads by 2025.
Some cars, coaches and lorries with self-driving features could even be operating on motorways in the next year, the Department for Transport said.
government's plans include a ""safety ambition"" for vehicles: that they should be as safe as a competent human driver. 
It says this will inform standards that need to be reached in order to be allowed to self-drive on the roads - and manufacturers could face sanctions if they are not met.
But the CDEI, a government expert body that leads its work on trustworthy innovation using data and AI, says the question of how safe autonomous vehicles should be is not one science alone can answer.
It says the public may have little tolerance for crashes that are seen as the fault of ""faceless technology companies or lax regulation"" even if, it adds, on average driverless cars are safer than humans.
And if the public expect self-driving cars to be as safe as trains or planes, it would require a 100-fold increase in average safety over manually driven cars, it warns.
""What we wanted to do was say there's not an easy answer to this question"" said Professor Jack Stilgoe of University College London who advised the CDEI. He suggested that establishing how safe they should be was a democratic decision.
CDEI says it is also important to consider how risk is distributed between different groups. Even if there are improvements in overall safety, ""some groups may see substantial safety improvements while others see none or even face new hazards"".
report advises that other risks will need scrutiny as the technology is rolled out.
One is the potential for bias in algorithms controlling the cars.
It warns that some groups, such as wheelchair users, may be underrepresented in data used to train the software algorithms which control the cars - potentially causing bias.
report also says that self-driving cars should be clearly identified, and that ""people have a right to know what sort of agents they are sharing the road with"".
An academic survey quoted by the CDEI in the report suggested that 86% of the public agreed with this.
Professor Stilgoe said there were also serious moral questions about how the testing of self-driving vehicles is conducted on public roads, as other road users could in effect become participants in these trials whether they liked it or not.
""There is something quite important about the ethical principle of informed consent,"" he said. 
gy might result in pressure to alter roads and the rules of the road to suit self-driving cars. 
Professor Stilgoe said these needed to be debated and discussed transparently.
""The danger is sort of sleepwalking in to a world in which these changes happen in order to suit one mode of transport - and the benefits then don't get spread very widely,"" he said.
On Friday, the government is publishing a policy paper setting out planned laws ready for the introduction of self-driving vehicles on British roads.
w laws will be brought forward when parliamentary time allows, the government has said. 
gislation is expected to state that manufacturers are responsible for the vehicle's actions when self-driving - something the Law Commission recommended earlier this year.
In April, proposed updates to the Highway Code were announced that would allow drivers to watch entertainment on a car's screen while the vehicle was self-driving. 
Initially this would likely be whilst the vehicle was driving at slow speed on a motorway, such as in congested traffic.
Vehicles that can drive themselves on motorways could be available to purchase within the next year, the government reiterated.
government has also repeated its goal of a wider rollout of self-driving technologies by 2025 and £100m of funding for industry and research.
m Research, the motor insurers' automotive research centre, welcomed the government's ambition but warned ""complete clarity around the driver's legal responsibilities"" was needed, along with transparency on how the technology is marketed, ""how the dealer describes systems when handing over the keys and how the self-driving system itself communicates with the driver""."
technology	Stalking fears over PimEyes facial search engine	"Privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch has made a complaint against face recognition search engine PimEyes.
PimEyes enables people to look for faces in images which have been posted publicly on the internet.
Big Brother Watch claims it facilitates stalking and has complained to the UK data and privacy watchdog.
But PimEyes' chief executive Giorgi Gobronidze says it poses fewer risks related to stalking than social media or other search engines.
Mr Gobronidze told the BBC that because PimEyes only searches images posted publicly anyone misusing it ""gets only the information available on the open internet"".
Big Brother Watch's complaint to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) claims that PimEyes has enabled ""surveillance and stalking on a scale previously unimaginable"".
Starting with a person's picture, PimEyes finds other photos of them published online. This could include images on photo-sharing sites, in blog posts and news articles, and on websites. 
Big Brother Watch says that by piecing together information associated with these images - for example the text of a blog post, or a photo on a workplace website - a stalker could work out a person's ""place of work, or indications of the area in which they live"".
""Images of anyone, including children, can be scoured and tracked across the internet,"" wrote Madeleine Stone, legal and policy officer at Big Brother Watch, as she announced the complaint.
She argued the tool could be secretly used by potential employers, university admissions officers, domestic abusers or stalkers, and said it threatened to ""end anonymity as we know it"".
mpaigners accuse PimEyes of unlawfully processing the biometric data of millions of UK citizens - arguing it does not obtain permission from those whose images are analysed. 
However, PimEyes told the BBC it was technically impossible to tell how many UK citizens' faces it has analysed. 
Mr Gobronidze also responded to accusations his search engine broke data protection law. He claimed it was ""technically impossible to reconstruct a single photo"" from the data the company held, ""even if we put our entire database on the open web"".
make full use of PimEyes, users need to take out one of three types of paid subscription.
In its terms and conditions, the site says it is intended to allow people to search for publicly available information about themselves. 
""PimEyes is not intended for the surveillance of others and is not designed for that purpose,"" it says.
But Big Brother Watch claims there are no safeguards against this. There has also been concern that the tool could be used to uncover the real identity of sex workers.
However Mr Gobronidze claims that PimEye's ""data security unit"" looks for suspicious activity, for example if a male user always looks for female individuals, or a user uploads a photo of a child.
And the site does allow people to opt out of their image appearing in results.
mpany argues that there are positive uses of the tool, telling the BBC that it:
However, another face recognition search engine has found itself in legal hot water. 
ClearviewAI's tool is not usable by the general public, and the firm says it is only available to law enforcement. Nonetheless it faced a £7.5m fine from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).
Responding to Big Brother Watch's call for an investigation the ICO said ""We are aware of this matter and we are assessing the information provided."""
technology	How to make movies without a huge carbon footprint	"green memo sent out by the production team of the programme Poldark asked that the location department use low-carbon suppliers of lighting and reusable batteries wherever possible.
request was vague and the expectations unclear. But such requests are increasingly mainstream and point to the growing awareness in the film and TV industry of its carbon dioxide emissions.
In film and TV production, the main sources of carbon emissions are transport and energy. According to the report Screen New Deal, the average big budget film production produces 2,840 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. It would take 3,709 acres of forest a year to absorb this amount. 
Half of this comes from fuel, 30% from energy utilities, and 16% from air travel.
Louise Smith focuses on transport and energy when she's brought in to advise a film or TV production on cutting its carbon footprint. She has worked on films including the most recent James Bond instalment No Time to Die and Jurassic World: Dominion. Unusually for people in this role, her background is in environmental science, rather than in film and TV.
""Usually I try and get involved as early as possible,"" says Ms Smith, a sustainability consultant with Neptune Environmental Solutions.
ws for her to assess the filming locations to see the needs for grid or mobile power. For on-set filming, the studio ideally has a renewable electricity contract already. 
A big energy issue is diesel, which has traditionally been used to power the heavy vehicles and generators needed for filming. Generators are especially important for filming on location in spots where the power grid can't be accessed.
Productions have increasingly been using renewable diesel (also known as hydrotreated vegetable oil or HVO), for instance for Downton Abbey: A New Era. 
While this renewable biodiesel is less polluting than conventional diesel, it is not a panacea.
Producing HVO requires a great deal of vegetable oil, which worries environmental groups, who argue that making biofuels like HVO could be diverting crops for food into energy production.
Some HVO is made from waste, including used cooking oil and animal fats. But these oils and fats are in short supply as they are used in other products, like pet food.
""HVO production just adds to the demand for these scarce feedstocks,"" says Maik Marahrens, who campaigns on biofuels and energy at the European NGO Transport & Environment. 
Ms Smith acknowledges that renewable diesel isn't a perfect solution. 
In this transitional period, she's encouraging the hybrid use of batteries with other types of power. ""Battery technology has come on super-fast in the UK in the last couple of years, in terms of the availability and the size and the capacity,"" she says. 
ws productions to co-ordinate their power systems, with batteries connected to power-hungry generators, and generators turned off overnight. 
ries might be sufficient to power, for instance, the fridges and freezers that need to run overnight, with the generators turned on automatically in the morning. This results in less energy use overall.
Improvement of mobile batteries and solar-powered generators is a technological challenge.
But there's also what Ms Smith refers to as a ""hearts and minds challenge"", which is to convince crews that they can get by with less. 
""There's not a lot of room for error in film because everything moves so quickly,"" Ms Smith says.
For example, it may make sense for a gaffer (chief lighting technician) to transport extra lighting equipment just to ensure that no time is lost if a director changes her mind. 
""So yes, there's a lot of built-in redundancy, and it's a problem in terms of efficiency,"" Ms Smith notes. ""That is a difficult one to manage, because those people's jobs are at stake if they get it wrong.""
In this case, Ms Smith might encourage more data gathering to determine how much energy is actually being used, to allow for just a little spare capacity. Using small generators and switching equipment on only when needed would help to reduce energy waste.
More technology of business:
Given how electrical teams have embraced LED lights, which use less power than tungsten bulbs, Ms Smith is optimistic about other energy-use changes.
She can also combine the environmental argument with cost and health arguments when she's making suggestions to producers. 
rticularly true at the moment, with high fuel prices and, in the UK, an end to a tax exemption for off-road diesel use.
Ms Smith can make the argument:  ""We've saved this many litres of fuel, and that means this many tonnes of CO2.
""Your crew had much nicer air to breathe. They're not next to a diesel generator for 12 hours a day.""
If generators can be removed altogether, there's also the advantage of a quieter set. This was apparent back in 2013 while shooting the film Bad Words, which only used solar energy. But it has been difficult to replicate this in other productions, which may have greater energy needs or film outside sunny locations like Los Angeles.
One place that has taken up the regulation challenge is Vancouver. A multi-agency effort there has normalised the use of renewable energy in filmmaking.
Board of Parks and Recreation devised a strategy to move away from gas and diesel-powered generators. The City of Vancouver offers discounts on shooting fees to productions without diesel generators. And the Reel Green initiative has built a network of electric power kiosks near filming locations, as well as offering resources related to clean energy.
Hunter Vaughan, an environmental media scholar at the University of Cambridge, says that Sardinia and Majorca, like Vancouver, have also leveraged their popularity as filming locations, ""forcing mobile productions that shoot there to adopt sustainable practices"" that are better not only for the environment, but also for local communities. 
For faster change, more places will need to follow suit."
technology	Skilled tech workers snapped up despite downturn	"Jaydeep Vacchani, a software developer in Toronto, began to hunt for a new job just as the surge of layoffs in the technology sector spread across the world.
Mr Vacchani found that his expertise in automation and cloud technology was in demand, and in October he had five interviews on the go.
Using cloud technology involves shifting data storage and processing to a third party like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft Azure. Meanwhile automation, in this case, means building software that streamlines labour-intensive work, like processing paperwork.
By November Mr Vacchani had found a ""perfect fit"" at sherpa°, a remote-only tech firm offering customers a way to secure travel visa documentation online.
""I like to work with a company that is focused on the user experience, especially when it comes to a product I can relate to, since I also had a challenging time trying to get the right visa paperwork when I moved to Canada from India,"" says Mr Vacchani, who is now a developer at the company's automation team.
He says this wave of heavy layoffs didn't faze him because of the demand for his skills: coding in the Javascript language, and managing the infrastructure for products and data housed in the cloud.
When Alex Gogan, VP of Engineering at sherpa°, seeks qualified candidates for software developer roles, he looks for a ""sweet spot of those who enjoy creative and collaborative work, and are really good at it, too.""
While the start-up first wanted to grow by hiring generalists in the tech sector, Mr Gogan says today they are seeking specialists who can focus on scaling the company and help others who may need mentoring.
It is a good time to be hiring workers with those kinds of skills. 
More than 900 tech companies have laid off 143,500 employees in 2022 alone, according to Layoffs.fyi which has been tracking layoffs in the tech sector since 2020. 
major tech firms have been slimming their workforces since the height of the pandemic.
Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, laid off more than 11,000 employees, and in November Amazon began letting go more than 10,000 staffers.
Some experts see these moves as a self-correction from the bloated workforces created during the pandemic, when tech companies such as Amazon and Shopify prospered during months when other businesses suffered. 
""The money spigot is not flowing at the same rate as it used to be,"" says Margaret O'Mara, author of The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.
""There's been a real softening of external capital resources, like VC (venture capital) funds, that had been propping up companies in Silicon Valley and beyond,"" she says.
rise in tech worker layoffs is also indicative of two other trends in this market, according to Lu Zhang, managing director of VC firm Fusion Fund in California. ""Companies now feel an urgency to reserve cash, and founders see those high salaries they once offered as not being very cost-efficient.""
As for the tech skills in high demand now, in Silicon Valley she sees demand for engineers experienced in artificial intelligence (AI) tech and data science.
reas are sought-after because companies are focusing on collecting and processing data, to better organise their business and learn more about their customers.
An OECD report echoes Ms Zhang: Job postings for digital roles in the US increased by 24% between 2018 and 2021, led by a 116% increase in adverts for data engineers.
Ms O'Mara sees another set of skillshiring tech companies find desirable: compassion and empathy. ""While there has been such a relentless focus on engineering skills, companies want to ensure that there are voices in the room that understand the sociology of the products they produce and the impact they have on various geographies and political systems,"" she says. 
She adds, ""With the money engine slowing done, I'd like to see more large, influential companies enter that stage of maturity.""
More technology of business:
Craig Freedberg, from UK-based specialist recruitment firm, Robert Half, says businesses will still have a need for tech resources and software development projects.
However, he thinks companies will be reluctant to expand their workforces and will instead turn to temporary tech workers.
""We've seen similar scenarios in other economic downturns and are already beginning to experience this shift in balance,"" he says.
What may also shift in the coming months is a ripple effect from the boom in remote work caused by the pandemic.
According to a recent report from Deloitte, most Gen Z (75%) and millennials (76%) would prefer to split home work with office work, or work full-time at home.
Could this erode Silicon Valley's attraction for ambitious software engineers and developers? After all, other cities like Lisbon and Toronto are offering attractive tax breaks in the hope of attracting tech entrepreneurs. 
Author Margaret O'Mara does not see a big exodus. ""Companies come here for the talent, to recruit the best people, and that's still happening in Silicon Valley,"" she notes.
But venture capitalist Lu Zhang views it another way. ""The new normal will be to rely on the core values within Silicon Valley to help founders get started and create their initial products and learn about market fit, but then to expand outside those borders to leverage talent outside Silicon Valley and remotely hire from other tech hubs."""
technology	The DIY gadgets that could keep your energy bill down	"Hidden in an attic in Chester, a tiny computer constantly downloads local weather data from the internet and uses it to save a homeowner money. 
gadget, no more than a handful of circuit boards and wiring in a small plastic case, is connected to a gas boiler. When it's warm outside, it turns the boiler flow temperature down as less energy is needed to heat the building. This is known as weather compensation.
""It's been running for about eight months now and it works perfectly,"" says Paul Pschierer-Barnfather, who built and installed the device himself. ""I should have done this years ago.""
re are branded products that work in a similar way, or which measure the outside air temperature directly and adjust the temperature of water sent to radiators accordingly.
But Mr Pschierer-Barnfather, who works for an electric car charging firm and has some technical know-how, says making the device himself cost only about £15.
It's a job that is probably best undertaken by someone who knows what they are doing.
Other techies have come up with gadgets and apps to help them reduce their bills and, given the soaring cost of energy at the moment, many are keen to share their experiences in the hope that they will benefit others.
Mr Pschierer-Barnfather's project began after he read about how lowering the flow temperature on a condensing gas combi boiler can improve its efficiency. 
flow temperature is the temperature to which a combi heats the water before it circulates among radiators. Lower flow temperatures mean more hot water vapour condenses within the boiler as it operates, which retains heat.
""When I started turning the boiler down, it probably cut the gas consumption by about 10%,"" says Mr Pschierer-Barnfather. 
He found that on very cold days he felt he had to turn the boiler back up again slightly, however, and that's when he decided to make a gadget to do this automatically. 
keeps the radiator flow temperature between 30C and 50C, which he finds is sufficient. 
fferent from altering the thermostat temperature and it is important to note that adjustments like this only apply to the radiator flow temperature on condensing gas combi boilers with separate hot water controls. Lowering the hot water temperature too much can allow the growth of bacteria, including legionella.
In the Midlands, programmer Tomás McGuinness has designed a different gizmo that uses sensors to read the flow temperatures on his boiler. It sends a notification to a smartphone app if the return flow rises above 55C, the approximate point at which the boiler would stop condensing. He can then fine-tune the temperature manually.
""My little sensor system, I could probably put it together for about a tenner,"" he says. Via Twitter, he's found several people who are willing to try prototypes of his device, which he says he might go on to produce for sale.
r measures, such as reducing his boiler's power consumption and insulating his home, have helped him take control of his energy expenditure, he adds.
However, Mr McGuinness says he is still concerned about the continuing rise in bills. 
Mr Pschierer-Barnfather agrees, adding that he feels ""lucky"" to have the skills required to reduce his gas bill slightly. He argues that fellow techies are in a position to help others shield themselves from energy price rises.
""For people who haven't got double glazing or haven't been able to do what I have with their boiler, they're going to get the full whack of this.
""We can help. We're a slightly geeky minority… I feel that there's more that we can do.""
More efficient boilers should be the norm, he says. 
Some installers don't set boilers up to run as efficiently as they could, or explain things such as condensing and flow temperature to homeowners, says Jo Alsop, founder of independent consumer advice organisation The Heating Hub.
However, based on enquiries to The Heating Hub, people do seem to be increasingly interested in finding out how to maximise the efficiency of their home energy systems, she adds.
A spokesman for Home Assistant, a software tool for controlling smart home tech, tells the BBC that he has also noticed a rise in queries about setting up energy management systems.
More technology of business:
Many people also monitor their home electricity demand closely. Glyn Hudson, co-founder of OpenEnergyMonitor, says it is possible to simply and safely attach a sensor to the cables exiting your electricity board and track energy consumption over time.
Dan Medhurst, who lives near Reading and who works in IT, has attached a sensor to the front of his electricity meter. It tracks the pulsing LED on the meter, which reveals how much power is flowing. The data is sent wirelessly to Home Assistant and he can check it at any time on his smartphone or computer.
It means Mr Medhurst can spot spikes in usage and, based on the time they occurred, can work out what appliances caused them. It made him realise just how much electricity his tumble dryer consumes, for example, and he also decided to turn his fridge temperature up, while still keeping the contents cold enough (5C or below).
recent example was the TV, however, he adds.
""I had the brightness and contrast turned up quite high… Just by turning it to eco mode the usage dropped from 100 watts down to 50 watts.""
result of closer monitoring and more careful use of his appliances has resulted in a greater than 10% drop in his electricity bill, he estimates, though he adds that the continuing price rises remain daunting.
Although small adjustments to home energy use will not eliminate the pain of rapidly rising bills, there is still value in it, especially when thousands or millions of homes get involved, says Abigail Dombey, chair of Hydrogen Sussex, an energy industry body.
Lowering domestic gas consumption means more gas is available for gas-fired power stations, which could help avoid blackouts, she says, and at scale this could alleviate pressure on the European energy system as a whole. Plus, the less gas that is burned, the less CO2 gets emitted into the atmosphere.
""These are tiny actions that actually can make colossal differences,"" she says."
technology	Tesla's Optimus and the problem with humanoids	"Fans of Tesla and Elon Musk were enthralled by the unveiling of Optimus, a prototype humanoid robot, in California last week. 
I also enjoyed the theatrics - but I'm not alone in wondering why, apart from the wow factor, Optimus had to be human-like.
And while the fans hate any perceived criticism, Mr Musk himself has said Optimus is nowhere near market-ready.
rgument made for humanoids is they are best equipped to work with human tools, in human environments. People may feel more comfortable interacting with something that looks like a bit like them. And of course, they look great.
But how practical are they?
""A lot of companies work in the area of humanoids because it's interesting for the public to see,"" Owen Nicholson, chief executive of Slamcore, which specialises in sensor-driven vision, says.
""But wheel-based robots and even drones are so much easier to control. The amount of work that goes into just getting a humanoid to stand upright is huge.""
Some of the falls experienced by competitors in the Darpa Robotics Challenge
robotics behind Optimus look sound - Tesla is not exactly a novice at all this - but, Mr Nicholson says, by its release, the machine will have evolved into something physically more practical.
""I'd put money on them having more wheel-based robots,"" he adds.
In my job, I have seen lots of robots - all shapes and sizes - designed to clean, care for the elderly, teach, perform surgery, work as receptionists and tour guides, play Scrabble and chess, sing and dance, mix cocktails, pack shopping, deliver groceries, have sex, perform search and rescue and build cars. 
You name it, somebody is probably trying to build a robot for it.
Some of them work better than others - and demonstrations rarely go to plan. 
But what the sci-fi films fail to show is all the wires, the pre-programming and the very brief battery life. As I discovered when trying to film them, early football-playing robots could last for only 10 minutes.
I have had excruciating ""conversations"" with conversational robots, watched many devices fail to complete the tasks they were designed for, and seen the panic in the eyes of the executives in the room when a developer brandishing a bunch of wires says: ""We just need to reboot.""
But robots have advanced considerably faster than humans in the past decade. The robots of 2022 are far more skilled than those I first saw, in 2008, whereas I have acquired little more than a few grey hairs.
me and time again though, the most impressive performers tend not to look like people. Precision-surgery robots, warehouse robots, window-cleaning robots - none of them is remotely humanoid.
Expectation may be part of the problem.
Humanoids might be expected to function like people, performing a variety of different tasks - mowing the lawn, making a sandwich, cuddling a baby. 
But Prof Helen Hastie, of the National Robotarium, in Edinburgh, says robots are a very long way off being able to multi-task.
""What's most important is that the robot is fit for the task it is designed for,"" she says.
Boston Dynamics' doglike quadruped Spot is ideally suited to rough terrains, such as bombed-out buildings - but a robot designed to, say, work in a kitchen may need no legs at all.
Robots designed to work with vulnerable people, for example in care homes, might be better suited to looking a bit more human - but not too much.
It is a phenomenon known as the uncanny valley - if something looks human-like but not believably so, it becomes unnerving and even frightening. 
As Prof Helen Hastie says: ""If it's too human-like, it will put off the human."" "
technology	Singapore's crypto ambitions shaken by FTX collapse	"re was a time when it seemed as though Singapore would become a global centre for cryptocurrency.
Authorities had signalled an early interest in harnessing blockchain technology. That, coupled with the city state's favourable business environment, attracted digital asset companies and a burgeoning community of investors.
In 2021, investment in the industry in Singapore increased tenfold compared to the previous year to $1.48bn (£1.2bn), according to KPMG, making up nearly half the Asia Pacific total for the year.
2022 could not have been more different.
Crypto assets and companies - many with links to Singapore - have imploded, causing reverberations and sparking losses around the world. 
First a popular token called Terra Luna collapsed, causing its sister token TerraUSD, which was largely stable, to plummet. 
A few months later, Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows filed for bankruptcy, taking down crypto exchange Voyager Digital with it. In August, crypto lender Hodlnaut became the next in a growing string of casualties.
It is thought that the closures of key market players this year has wiped out $1.5 trillion in crypto market capitalisation.
November, billions were lost within a matter of days, when US crypto exchange FTX spectacularly collapsed because of a crippling liquidity crunch. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has since been charged by US authorities with ""one of the biggest financial frauds in US history"".
For Singapore, the FTX collapse was particularly shocking. Its state investment fund Temasek had invested in the exchange, pumping in $275m over several months. 
masek says it will write down the money, and is conducting an internal review into the investment.
fund is worth more than $295bn and so the FTX investment makes up a small percentage of its public wealth portfolio.
But Singapore's deputy prime minister, who is also finance minister, told parliament the loss had caused reputational damage.
""The fact that other leading global institutional investors like BlackRock and Sequoia Capital also invested in FTX does not mitigate this,"" Lawrence Wong said.
rs were hurt too, and many believe the Singaporean authorities should have done more.
Nicole Yap, 26, says she didn't flinch about investing in the exchange because so many big companies were backing it. She has lost roughly $150,000 (£122,000), but feels the onus should not be on the user entirely.
""You need the regulation - the government or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) - to say, 'these companies are good, we've seen their books,'"" Ms Yap says.
""Just because there is a lot of scam in crypto, doesn't mean crypto is a scam. But users don't have a platform to find out about these things. We only have social media and crypto influencers.""
Carol Lim started investing in cryptocurrency during the pandemic. The 52-year-old was hoping to make enough money to retire in the next few years. 
""I invested with Hodlnaut because the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) endorsed it. In today's value, I lost about $55,000. I can only hope to get some of it back.""
Hodlnaut was one of a handful of firms that was granted in-principle approval to provide digital payment services by Singapore's central bank. The licence approval was rescinded when the lender was forced to stop withdrawals because of market conditions.
""The core of the problem is that there is some misunderstanding amongst regulators. They want to attract businesses to their jurisdiction, but you need to regulate in such a way that consumers are safe,"" says Michael Gronager, CEO and co-founder of blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis.
Mr Gronager says that because consumers are so global these days, regulators need to decide whether to implement laws on the company - for example, giving them a licence to operate in the country - or to restrict trading access to retail investors.
FTX did not have a licence to operate in Singapore. However, MAS has said it is not possible to prevent local users from accessing overseas service providers.
""We will see fraud, fast money in the industry - that's no surprise. We see it in the internet, we see it in all sorts of traditional industries,"" Mr Gronager says.
Singapore had started introducing new measures even before the FTX saga, warning that the technology can be volatile and speculative. It banned crypto advertising earlier this year and is investigating a number of outlets present in the island nation.
Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, left Singapore last year after it was put on an investor alert list for soliciting customers without the requisite licence, and offering Singapore dollar trades. 
rackdown has attracted criticism from industry players as a result, for instance from Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of US-based crypto exchange platform Coinbase.
""Singapore wants to be a hub for Web3 (a vision of the next iteration of the internet that uses blockchains and cryptocurrencies), and then simultaneously says: 'Oh, we're not really going to allow retail trading or self-hosted wallets to be available,"" he said at the Singapore FinTech Festival in November. 
""Those two things are incompatible in my mind,"" he added.
Singapore's government says it remains enthusiastic about crypto and still wants to become a virtual-asset hub, with a focus on the business and administrative side of blockchain technology.
It has vowed to contain risks, by proposing knowledge tests for retail investors before being allowed to trade, and has acknowledged this could mean retail-focused companies may move to other jurisdictions.
""Cryptocurrency platforms can collapse due to fraud, unsustainable business models, or excessive risk taking. FTX is not the first cryptocurrency platform to collapse, nor will it be the last,"" Mr Wong said.
""Those who trade in cryptocurrencies must be prepared to lose all their value. No amount of regulation can remove this risk."""

firm said it had 221.1 million subscriptions across its three streaming platforms as of 2 July.
rasts with rival Netflix which has been losing customers.
But Disney warned that its loss of streaming rights for cricket in India would reduce its subscriber growth compared to previous forecasts. 
firm, which also owns general audience television platform Hulu and the sports-focused ESPN+, said demand for its Disney+ product remained strong. 
Pandemic lockdowns provided a boost to streaming services like Disney, but the easing of Covid restrictions doesn't seem to be preventing it attracting new customers.
mpany added 14.4 million Disney+ accounts in the quarter, many of them outside of the US - far more than analysts had expected.
Later this year it will launch a new ad-funded service, which will still be charged at the current subscription rate of $7.99. The charge for the ad-free service will rise to $10.99 per month.
firm plans to launch its ad-funded service outside the US next year.
Executives said they do not expect the rise in prices to put off customers over the long term. The firm is also seeing strong interest from companies hoping to advertise on the new service, they said.
""We are in a position of strength with record upfront advertising commitment,"" chief executive Bob Chapek told analysts in a conference call to discuss the firm's financial results.
Disney's subscriber gains have come at a hefty cost, with its streaming business losing $1.1bn in the quarter.
Executives said they expect losses to peak this year, In the meantime, a strong rebound in attendance at its theme parks since the worst of the pandemic has provided the firm with a large financial cushion.
revenues in the April-June period jumped 26% from last year, pushing profits to $1.5bn.
Shares in the company jumped more than 6% in after-hours trade after the firm shared its results.
Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, called it a ""pivotal moment in the streaming wars"" saying Disney had more room to grow than arch-rival Netflix.
Netflix lost nearly one million accounts in the most recent quarter, putting its membership total at 220.67 million.
just behind Disney at more than 221 million subscriptions. Disney counts each subscription to a streaming platform separately, meaning customers who pay for more than one service are counted more than once.
""[The results] firmly underline my belief that Disney is at a different phase of growth to Netflix,"" said Mr Pescatore. ""There are still millions of users to acquire as it continues to expand into new markets and rolls out new blockbuster shows."""
technology	San Francisco to allow police 'killer robots'	"San Francisco's ruling Board of Supervisors has voted to let the city's police use robots that can kill.
measure permits police to deploy robots equipped with explosives in extreme circumstances.
Dr Catherine Connolly, from the group Stop Killer Robots, said the move was a ""slippery slope"" that could distance humans from killing.
's police - the SFPD - told the BBC they do not currently operate any robots equipped with lethal force.
ugh that there may be future scenarios in which lethal force could be used by a robot.
A spokesperson for the police said ""robots could potentially be equipped with explosive charges to breach fortified structures containing violent, armed, or dangerous subjects"". 
robots could be used to ""incapacitate, or disorient violent, armed, or dangerous suspects who pose a risk of loss of life"". 
Advocates for the measure said it would only be used in extreme situations. 
Opponents, however, say the authority could lead to further militarisation of the police force.
measure passed, with an amendment on Tuesday specifying that officers could only use robots wielding deadly force after employing alternative de-escalation tactics. 
rd also stipulated that only a limited number of high-ranking officers could authorise its use.
f lethal robot is already in use in other parts of the United States.
In 2016, police in Dallas, Texas, used a robot armed with C-4 explosive to kill a sniper who had killed two officers and injured several more.
SFPD said the department does not currently own any robots outfitted with lethal force, but said the measure might be needed in the future.
""No policy can anticipate every conceivable situation or exceptional circumstance which officers may face. The SFPD must be prepared, and have the ability, to respond proportionally,"" a spokesperson said. 
federal government has long dispensed military grade equipment, camouflage uniforms, bayonets and armoured vehicles to help local law enforcement.
But a California state law passed this year now requires city police forces to inventory military-grade equipment and seek approval for their use.
Dr Catherine Connolly, from the campaign group Stop Killer Robots, said the move could ""make humans more and more distant from the use of force and the consequences of the use of force"". 
She also said the measure could make it ""easier to make decisions to use lethal force in the first place""."

Details about the hack were suppressed by then-prime minister Boris Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, The Mail on Sunday claimed, citing what it said amounted to a ""news blackout"" imposed by Mr Case.
wspaper also said private messages exchanged between Ms Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, her close friend whom she made chancellor when she became prime minister, were also uncovered by the alleged hack.
It is not clear how any hack happened, but opposition parties have seized on the issue.

technology	Shaking head and mean goose among new emojis	"A shaking head, new heart colours and a familiar goose are among a new group of emojis set to be released this year.
Unicode Consortium's list contains only 31 new emojis, which expand what can be said through pictures and symbols in text and online messages.
much smaller release than last year's 112 emojis, which included pregnant people, a crutch and a low battery sign.  
uccinct release has been met with a mostly positive response online.
mojis will go through a final round of approval in September before they are released.
Emoji reference website Emojipedia said while some emojis may not make the final version, most that reach this stage are confirmed.
usion of the goose emoji has drawn comparisons to modern indie gaming hit Untitled Goose Game, which sees players take control of a horrible goose.
But while the design may seem familiar, it may not necessarily look the same when it appears on phones.
gns seen here are samples designed by Emojipedia for the Emoji 15.0 release. Companies including Apple, Google and Samsung must make their own designs for the emojis.
mojis are selected by Unicode Consortium, a non-profit organisation based in California.
Keith Broni, editor in chief of Emojipedia, said the smaller number of emojis this year was an ""intentional choice"".
""The Unicode emoji subcommittee want to take more time to consider what will go on the emoji keyboard,"" he said. ""In previous years a lot of things were added. 
""They want to look at what can we add that is going to represent symbols that we know or experiences we have had - things like a face being shook or the pink hearts.""
He said people were excited to see the pink heart emoji finally included, but he was particularly interested in the utility of the shaking head.
""It is most likely going to be used when we are metaphorically or physically shook,"" he said. ""But a lot of the rationale behind this has been - how can we convey what happens to a person when they're undergoing the experience of being in an earthquake? 
""It's also quite a common visual cue in comic books and cartoons, where people shake their heads so rapidly because they're shocked or flabbergasted.""
He added that their designer probably took ""healthy inspiration"" from the goose video game for the relevant emoji - but it has meaning beyond that.
""In the case of the goose, the concept goes back to how we use language in an expressive way,"" he said. ""What other things can we say with these emojis?
""How can we forget the English idiom 'silly goose'? Through the emoji, that English language idiom becomes a piece of knowledge that can be represented across cultures."""

Supermarket grocery delivery robots are set to become a familiar sight on the streets of a Leeds suburb.

According to the firm, the robots are a more ""sustainable and affordable way to get groceries delivered to your door"", with an average delivery for a robot consuming as little energy as boiling a kettle to make just one cup of tea.
robots are also lightweight and travel at human walking pace - no faster than 4mph (6km/h).

technology	Tesla sales climb but miss expectations	"Supply shortages, logistics bottlenecks and rising costs are hitting Tesla as it rapidly ramps up production of its electric cars.
While the problems have improved in recent months, they remain immediate challenges, Tesla said in a financial update for investors.
Revenue was lower than expected in the three months ending in September, as car sales fell short of expectations.
But at $21.45bn (£19.12bn), it remained more than 50% higher than a year ago.
, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has been growing aggressively in recent years, opening new factories in the US, China and Germany and boosting output. 
mpany delivered 343,000 cars in the quarter - a record that was up more than 40% from the same period last year. 
firm produced more cars than were sold, raising fears that demand may be slowing, as rising prices, higher borrowing costs and a major economic slowdown in the key China market discourage buyers.
Mr Musk conceded there was weakness in China but beat back suggestions that demand was cooling.
When Tesla shared the delivery figures earlier this month, the company said the gap was due to difficulty finding vehicles to transport cars to customers. 
""There weren't enough boats, there weren't enough trains there weren't enough car carriers,"" he said on a conference call to discuss the results, adding that the firm expects to sell every car it makes. 
Deliveries of its own much anticipated electric truck are due to start in December, the firm said. The company reported $3.3bn in profit, up significantly from a year ago.
But questions about Tesla's growth path, as well as billions of dollars in stock sales by Mr Musk as he prepares a $44bn takeover of Twitter, have weighed on the company's shares in recent months.
re price has dropped 40% this year, wiping billions of dollars off the company's value. Its shares fell a further 4% in after-market trading on Wednesday. 
""I think Tesla's had a hard quarter and the market is responding to that,"" Sarah Kunst, managing director of Cleo Capital, told the BBC's Today programme.
""The auto industry in general right now is having a very hard time because supply chain problems persist and the batteries - particularly for electric vehicles - are hard to come by,"" she said.
""And the reality is that Tesla used to be the only place to go to buy a higher-end electric car and that's increasingly not the case."" 
minates the electric vehicle market in the US, but it faces far more competition in Europe and China, where such cars are more popular.
In the US, rivals have also been ramping up their efforts. 
German carmaker BMW said on Wednesday that it would spend $1.7bn to expand its electric vehicle production in the US. 
A few months ago Elon Musk - no shrinking violet when it comes to self-promotion - said demand for Teslas was through the roof.
""Right now demand is exceeding production to a ridiculous degree,"" he said. 
And yet from these figures, that doesn't seem to be happening. 
In fact Tesla is making more cars than it's selling. 
Not only that, but there are a series of financial pressures eating away at profitability. Supply chain issues and the costs of raw materials are hurting profits. 
rs are much more concerned about its long-term potential than short term financial pressures though. 
's why the uncertainty about demand for Teslas is particularly damaging. It helps to explain why a seemingly solid set of results has seen a fall in Tesla's share price. 
It also explains why Mr Musk looked to kibosh talk of demand issues on the earnings call. ""I can't emphasise enough we have excellent demand for [the fourth quarter] and we expect to sell every car we can make as far in the future as we can see,"" he said.
However, many Tesla investors worry that Mr Musk isn't spending enough time on the company - after committing to buy Twitter. These results won't likely change that view. "
technology	Syria war: UN extends aid lifeline to rebel-held Idlib by six months	"UN Security Council has reauthorised cross-border deliveries of aid to rebel-held Syria for six months.
Western powers bowed to a demand from Russia, a staunch ally of the Syrian government, which vetoed their proposal for a one-year extension last week.
mandate for deliveries via Turkey expired on Sunday, prompting the UN aid chief to warn that ""people will die"".
Some 800 lorries cross into the north-western province of Idlib every month with aid for 2.4 million civilians.
Almost double that number of people, mostly women and children, are trapped in the last stronghold of the jihadist and Turkish-backed rebel groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad after 11 years of brutal conflict.
An estimated 70% of the civilians already do not have enough to eat at a time when food prices are continuing to rise sharply and one in three children are undernourished, according to the UN.
More than 1.7 million internally displaced people are also having to live in dire conditions in tented camps and informal settlements with limited access to water, sanitation and healthcare.
region also regularly sees deadly clashes, air strikes and shelling despite a ceasefire brokered by Russia and Turkey in 2020 to halt a government assault.
More than 56,000 lorries carrying food, medicine, shelters and other live-saving aid have gone into areas of Syria outside the government's control since 2014, when the Security Council authorised the UN's first such cross-border humanitarian operation.
In 2020, Russia and China used their veto powers as permanent council members to stop UN deliveries via Jordan and Iraq, as well as one of the two Turkish border points. 
rgued that the operation violated Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and that the aid should cross the front lines via government-controlled territory. 
move meant people living in the Kurdish-controlled north-eastern Syria had to start relying on shipments via Damascus and left the Bab al-Hawa crossing as the UN's only option to access Idlib.
On Friday, Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution drafted by Ireland and Norway that would have extended authorisation for deliveries via Bab al-Hawa for another year, while the US, UK and France blocked a Russian proposal for a six-month renewal.
US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield called it a ""dark day"" for the Security Council. ""This was a life-or-death vote for the Syrian people and Russia chose the latter,"" she told reporters. 
She warned that a six-month extension ""could leave Syrians without blankets in the dead of winter"" and would deny the UN its partners the time to organise the reliable supply of aid. 
""There's no need to fight and you know it perfectly well!"" Russian deputy ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy responded on Twitter, adding: ""We just insist on making humanitarian assistance to Syria more efficient and transparent."" 
Diplomats failed to agree a compromise before the mandate for the operation expired on Sunday night, despite UN aid chief Martin Griffiths warning that ""people will die, and they won't have vaccinations, and they won't have housing"". He stressed that ""cross-line"" deliveries were not a viable alternative to the massive cross-border operation. 
Western powers eventually bowed to Russia's demand for a six-month extension of deliveries through the Bab al-Hawa crossing until January 2023, after Mr Polyanskiy continued to insist that anything else would be vetoed.
Russia, China and 10 other countries voted in favour of the resolution on Tuesday, while the US, UK and France abstained to register their anger.
Ms Thomas-Greenfield claimed afterwards that the aid operation's mandate had been ""held hostage"" by Russia.
""When I spoke to UN experts and NGOs over the weekend, they told us that a temporary extension is, of course, better than nothing. So we did not block this resolution, even though it falls far short of the Security Council's duty to the Syrian people,"" she added.
In a separate development in north-west Syria on Tuesday, the US military announced that it had killed the leader of the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in Syria, Maher al-Agal, in a drone strike. 
A US Central Command statement said Agal was ""responsible for aggressively pursuing the development of [IS] networks outside of Iraq and Syria"" and that his removal would disrupt the group's ability to carry out global attacks.
It added that a senior IS official closely associated Agal with was seriously injured in the strike, which targeted a motorbike near Jindayris on Tuesday. First responders from the White Helmets said two people had been killed.

reveal how the pair's relationship, after a good start, went dramatically south. 
In late March, it became clear that Elon Musk was interested in purchasing shares in Twitter - and potentially sitting on Twitter's board. 
On 27 March, Parag Agrawal reaches out: ""Hey Elon - great to be connected directly. Would love to chat,"" he says.
Elon Musk likes the message. ""Perhaps tonight around 8?"" he says. So far so good.
By 31 March, a hastily planned dinner is arranged near San Jose as the deal really starts heating up. 
f developments is clearly exhilarating for Mr Agrawal. The world's richest person is about to become a Twitter board member. Mr Agrawal tells Mr Musk he's ""excited"" to see him in person. 
Bret Taylor, Twitter's board chair, texts Musk about the dinner. ""I think they were looking for an Airbnb near the airport and there are tractors and donkeys,"" he says in a text. The location, he continues, ""wins for the weirdest place I've had a meeting recently"".
r goes well despite the farmyard location. ""Memorable for multiple reasons. Really enjoyed it"", Mr Agrawal says.
A few days later it's announced that Elon Musk is to join the board. 
""Super excited"" Mr Agrawal messages.
As the announcement goes public, all sorts of names begin to text Mr Musk. 
Podcaster Joe Rogan asks Mr Musk whether he is going to ""liberate Twitter from the censorship happy mob"".
""I will provide advice, which they may or may not choose to follow,"" Mr Musk replies.
On 5 April, Jack Dorsey, former chief executive of Twitter, tells Mr Musk that Mr Agrawal is an ""incredible engineer"", but that Twitter's board is ""terrible"". 
By 7 April, Mr Agrawal and Mr Musk are burnishing their coding credentials - the start of a seemingly beautiful working relationship. 
""I wrote heavy duty software for 20 years,"" Mr Musk says. ""I interface way better with engineers who are able to do the hardcore programming than with program manager/MBA types"". 
Agrawal replies: ""In our next convo - treat me like an engineer instead of a CEO and let's see where we get to.""
""You got it"", Mr Musk replies.
But then disaster. 
On 9 April, Mr Musk tweets asking why so few of Twitter's most followed accounts tweeted very much. ""Is Twitter dying?"" he asks. 
weet angers Mr Agrawal. Later that day he messages: 
""You are free to tweet 'is Twitter dying?' or anything else about Twitter - but it's my responsibility to tell you that it's not helping me make Twitter better in the current context. 
""Next time we speak, I'd like to you provide you [sic] perspective on the level of the internal distraction right now and how it [sic] hurting our ability to do work.""
Elon Musk, notoriously, does not like being told what to do - especially whether and what he can tweet. 
We can't be certain what is going on behind the scenes, but this message seems to have infuriated Elon Musk. A few hours later he shoots off a volley of irascible messages. 
""What did you get done this week?... I'm not joining the board… This is a waste of time. Will make an offer to take Twitter private.""
Mr Agrawal appears bewildered by the texts.
He rings Bret Taylor, who desperately tries to understand what is going on. 
""Parag just called me and mentioned your text conversations. Can you talk?"" he says.
""Fixing Twitter by chatting with Parag won't work,"" Mr Musk says. ""Drastic action is needed.""
""Can you take 10 minutes to talk through with me?"" Mr Taylor asks. 
""It has been about 24 hours since you joined the board. I get your point, but just want to understand about the sudden pivot,"" he continues.
Elon Musk follows through. He offers $44bn to take Twitter private. On 25 April, the board accepts the offer. 
xt day, Jack Dorsey makes another attempt to patch up the relationship between the two. He organises a call. It doesn't go well.
""You and I are in complete agreement,"" Mr Musk messages Mr Dorsey after the conversation. ""Parag is just moving far too slowly and trying to please people who will not be happy no matter what he does.""
Mr Dorsey replies: ""At least it became clear that you can't work together.""
From there the relationship between Mr Musk and Twitter gets worse and worse. 
Mr Musk eventually attempts to pull out of the deal entirely in July.  But Twitter still approves the purchase in September.
A court case in Delaware in mid-October will decide whether he will be allowed to walk away - or forced to buy the company. 
But the messages show that the relationship between Twitter's CEO and Mr Musk had broken down far earlier. 
uggest that if Mr Musk is made to buy Twitter - Parag Agrawal will need to look for another job.

Last year, a ""market study"" by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) concluded they had a ""stranglehold"" over operating systems, app stores and web browsers on mobile devices.
If the 18-month investigation finds an adverse effect on competition, the CMA can impose changes.
Both companies deny the accusations.
CMA interim chief executive Sarah Cardell said it wanted to ensure UK:
""Many UK businesses and web developers tell us they feel that they are being held back by restrictions set by Apple and Google,"" she added.
In the UK, the CMA says:
Google said its Android operating system offered a greater choice of apps and app stores than any other mobile platform. It enabled developers ""to choose the browser engine they want and has been the launchpad for millions of apps"". 
Apple said it ""believes in vibrant and competitive markets where innovation can thrive"". 
Its App Store had helped millions of developers turn their ideas into apps, which had supported hundreds of thousands of jobs in the UK alone, it said.
""We will continue to engage constructively with the Competition and Markets Authority to explain how our approach promotes competition and choice, while ensuring consumers' privacy and security are always protected,"" Apple added."
technology	Are we falling in love with robots?	"It's a fiercely hot afternoon in Milton Keynes and I'm chasing a small orange flag as it waggles just above a line of low garden walls. The flag is attached to a white robot with six wheels and I'm relieved to see that it's slowing down to a halt. 
Cristiane Bonifacio has just extracted a large chocolate bar from the robot that has rolled up outside her home. Ms Bonifacio is in a hurry and has to dash back indoors for a work Zoom call, but she's got just enough time to express her affection for the robot delivery service that sends these machines scuttling along her local pavements.
""I love the robots. Sometimes you find one that's got stuck so you help it and it says 'thank you'.""
robot delivery service from Starship Technologies was launched in Milton Keynes four years ago and has been steadily expanding ever since, with further towns added just last month.
After decades of playing the villain in science fiction, robots are now part of life in many towns and people haven't just embraced them, they rush to assist them. What is going on?
Amber Case is an Oregon-based specialist in human-robot interaction and the way technology changes everyday life. ""In the movies robots are always a technology that's attacking us. But the delivery robots wait for us and we use them."" 
She thinks occasions when a robot hits an obstacle and requires help from a passer-by are a crucial part of the human-robot relationship. ""Technology can be adorable if it needs our assistance. We like a robot that needs us a bit, and when we help the robot it creates a bond."" 
Curiously, Ms Case is critical of the Starship Technologies delivery robots that pepper the pavements of Milton Keynes. 
re battery-powered, summoned and opened by an app, equipped with sensors to detect pedestrians and armed with a speaker. This allows a remote human operator to address people observed through on-board video cameras. 
Yet this arsenal of tech is not being applied correctly, she says. ""I feel they are automating the wrong part of the journey. Humans are really good at negotiating terrain and finding a particular house. Is this just a fetish for automating things?""
Despite these reservations she concedes that ""the Starship team have gone about it the right way, understanding how to make sure it's not scary, but cute. It seems they think more about the design than some robot makers and a well-designed robot is more likely to succeed."" 
gn element of the Starship robot chimes with the public. Victoria Butterworth recalls that the robots were one reason she moved to Milton Keynes. 
""They caught my attention, they're so quirky and original.""
She adds that ""of course there were lots of other reasons to move here"", but the robots came to play an important part in her life when her dachshund developed disc displacement and needed constant attention. 
robots allowed her to care for the dog without leaving her home to shop. ""They were a real godsend when the dog was ill."" 
uman-robot bond emerging in Milton Keynes has banished the stereotype of a menacing robot, she says.
""When you see one you don't get that science-fiction emotion of 'Oh No! It's a robot!' It's more like a cute little character you see on the street. It makes your walk more colourful.""   
Andy Curtis, Starship's UK operations manager who is in charge of 180 robots in Milton Keynes, talks about each machine operating in a ""bubble of awareness"" that allows it to alert people to its presence and offer thanks if they assist it. ""It's designed to be cute, not to be invasive.""
gentle demeanour is more than incidental. It pays off, says Mr Curtis. ""People will jump in if a robot struggles on a difficult surface and it plays back a thank you message."" 
More technology of business:
In Starship's native Estonia, pedestrians come to the rescue when robots encounter snow and ice on the streets of Tallinn, pulling them onto the pavement to be repaid with that popular voice of thanks.  
Adam Rang, a businessman in Tallinn, confesses to being excited by the robots. But it's not an emotion his two-year-old son shares. ""I point them out to him but he doesn't care. He's more interested in buses. It shows how normal they are to people born today, even though we've been waiting all our lives for robots like the ones promised in science fiction.""
He adds that drivers in Tallinn are accustomed to halting at pedestrian crossings to let the robots pass over, even though Estonian traffic law does not afford them pedestrian rights. 
He believes that part of our affection for the robots stems from disappointment with a promised future that didn't appear. ""A lot of science fiction predictions didn't work out. But the robots give us the future we were promised."" 
Back in Milton Keynes the robots queue up outside Moores Fish & Chips on a Friday night. Co-owner Johnny Pereira explains why this mix of traditional and hi-tech has proved a hit with his regular customers and bedded in with the locals. 
""Parents like to order robot-delivered fish and chips for the family, it's popular with kids. It's definitely increased business. But I can spot when customers sitting outside are new to Milton Keynes - they stare at the robots! People who live here are used to them.""  
At the local robot hub beside a mini-supermarket the little machines line up on the pavement, waiting for their next order. 
Stephanie Daniels and her son, Noah, have dropped by and they too are impressed by robotic good manners. ""I like it, they're very innovative, they have very good sensors. They're very cool and very weird at the same time. And they say 'Thank you!'"" "
