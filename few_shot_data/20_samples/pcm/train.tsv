Dem accuse di president of covering up di theft of one large sum of foreign currency from im farm in 2020, some of which bin dey hidden inside one sofa. Di debate before di vote bin focus on an independent report wey conclude say e fit don violate di constitution. Oga Ramaphosa, wey dey prepare for re-election as ANC leader, deny any wrongdoing. Di African National Congress bin tell im MPs to block possible impeachment - although a handful break ranks and join hand with opposition parties and vote to accept di report and let impeachment proceedings start. Now wey Oga Ramaphosa don survive di vote, belief dey say e dey likely to win re-election for im party conference, wey go start on Friday. E go den be in pole position to become di ANC presidential candidate for di next election in 2024. Di sitting to debate to di report, wey dey commission from one panel of legal experts by di speaker, open wit one discussion over whether dem should allow MPs to vote in secret - something wey di speaker bin reject. At di end of di debate, dem read out di names of individual MPs and each one announce dia vote. Some 214 lawmakers vote against setting up impeachment committee, while 148 vote in favour, dem register two abstention. Di 70-year-old leader don deny any wrongdoing calling di report, wey e don also challenge for di Constitutional Court, ""flawed"". Oga Ramaphosa become president for 2018 pledging to tackle corruption. Naim  replace Jacob Zuma, whose time for office bin dey weighed down by many such allegations. Dis scandal show facein June, wen one former South African spy boss, Zuma-ally Arthur Fraser, file one complaint wit police accusingdi president of hiding theft of $4m (£3.25m) in cash from im Phala Phala game farm in 2020. Oga Ramaphosa admit say dem bin tiff some money, wey bin dey hidden in a sofa, but e say na $580,000 not $4m. Di president say di $580,000 bin come from di sale of buffalo, but di panel, wey dey headed by one former chief justice, say e get ""substantial doubt"" about whether a sale take place. South Africa get strict rules on holding foreign currency, wey say dat it gatz dey deposited with an authorised dealer such as bank with 30 days.

Di president argue say di panel go beyond im scope wen dem dey look  at whether e bin get a case to answer related to di robbery for di farm. E dey also ask di court make dem declare say any steps wey di parliament take on di back of di release of the report dey unlawful and invalid. Analysis by Nomsa Maseko, BBC News, Johannesburg Di dominance of di ANC for parliament don save Oga Ramaphosa future in politics. Im chances of being re-elected as ANC president for di party national conference now don get more boost. However, events for parliament show say once again deep divisionsdey for di governing party. Four Pro-Zuma supporters, wey include former African Union chairperson, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma - one ogbonge party member - bin vote with opposition parties. Di opposition bin try, and fail, to push for secret ballot as dem sense say more members fit break ranks. But Tuesday win na only political, and not legally binding. Oga Ramaphosa go still need to get di Constitutional Court to weigh in on di mata, though some experts say di judges dey likely to side wit am afta parliament, wey commission di investigate, bin reject im own report. For now, on top of one huge sigh of relief, Oga Ramaphosa march on wit severe political bruises - im credibility and ability to govern go come into even sharper focus."

health	Vagina health and sex: 24 things about vagina every woman suppose know	"Many women no too sabi plenty things about dia vagina. Even for dis 21st century, tori about anatomy, monthly changes, hygiene and plenty tori wey dem fit dey experience still dey strange to some women. Some experts don put together some things wey fit help women understand dia female sexual organ [vagina] beta. Di vagina dey inside di body - na di elastic muscular canal wey connect di vulva to di cervix and di uterus. Vulva na di correct word to use wen you dey tok about di external part of di female sex organs. Na di vulva hold di pubis, urethral opening, clitoris, labia minora and the labia majora and vaginal opening. Di external structure of di vulva consist of di labia majora - dis na di outer lips of di vagina, di labia minora - di inner lips and di clitoris - one highly sensitive & erogenous zone wey get more nerve endings than any other part of woman body. Dis fit shock you. While men dey pee from their penis, women dey pee from di urethra (one tubular structure wey dey carry piss from di bladder to outside of di body). From front to back, di first hole na di urethra and then di vagina, wey dey above di anus. Public hair get work wey e dey do. E dey serve as protective barrier to di genital tissues and vaginal opening. E also dey prevent infection. Obstetrician-gynaecologist, Dr Jen Gunter say she notice say plenty women dey like shave dia pubic hair. She say e dey okay but e get risk. Dr Gunter add join say waxing or shaving of di pubic hair fit cause microscopic trauma to di skin, plus e fit cause cuts, abrasions, infections. Many women dey shy to tok about di pain dem dey experience during kerewa [sex]. However, E dey important to know say sex no suppose dey painful. Sabi pipo advise say if you dey experience any kain pain during kerewa visit your doctor or gynaecologist. Di glands wey dey located for di lining of di vagina dey release one fluid wey naturally dey designed to dey lubricate and cleanse di vagina. When you use some kain soaps or cleaning devices, dem fit cause react wit di vagina natural pH balance and cause infections like thrush. To avoid dis, apply soap for di outer labia only. Dr Gunter say you no need use anything clean inside di vagina. She warn against using scented douches alias bathing soap as e fit increase di risk of catching sexually transmitted infections. Steaming, another trend, no dey necessary, e fit lead to burns. You fit clean di outer part of di vulval area when necessary wit water or a gentle cleanser. Vaginal cells dey replace themselves every 96 hours - e dey quick heal. You still fit catch some STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) even if you use condom. STDs like herpes, HPV, pubic lice and molluscum contagiosum still dey transferable. Dis na because di vulva still fit touch di blocus (or vice versa), during sex and dis fit cause infection. Most women no dey reach climax through vaginal penetration and sometimes dey need clitoral stimulation before dem fit experience orgasm. Dem fit achieve orgasm through masturbation, manual or cunnilingual stimulation by a sexual partner. Plenty lubrication of di vagina dey prevent painful sex and tissue tearing. Vaginal lubrication dey affected by di level of oestrogen for di body. Things like using birth control, menopause and breastfeeding fit change di oestrogen levels. Di lower your oestrogen levels, di more difficult e go dey for your vagina to lubricate naturally. As women dey grow old, di natural lubrication [wey be di wetness for di vagina] go dey dry up. Dem fit begin topical oestrogen treatments or manufactured vaginal lubricants to lubricate. If you get very dry vagina, you fit speak to your doctor and get solution. Whether you do operation (C-section) or you born naturally, most physicians dey recommend taking at least four to six weeks off before you begin kerewa, make di vagina for fit heal well-well. To dey get orgasm fit help relieve menstrual pain. Dis na because of di increase of blood flow wey dey occur during climaxing. In addition, when you orgasm, your uterine muscles go contract and release chemicals di brain wey go generate one natural pain reliever for menstrual cramps. Afta years of doing periods and maybe to born children, di ovaries go stop to dey produce eggs and menstruation go stop. Di amount of hormones for di body wey dey keep women fertile go drop dramatically - and low levels of oestrogen, in particular, dey affect di vagina and vulva. Vaginal farting [to mess] wey pipo sabi as ""queefing"", go happun to most women at some point for dia lives, especially during exercise and intercourse. Dis na because air dey escape from vagina and e go make dem dey mess. Pregnancy and childbirth fit change di vagina in plenty ways; Every single woman get different vagina odour sake of dia choice of fabric, from wetin dem like use as underwear, level of hygiene, diet, gland secretion and unique mix of internal bacteria. Di quality and quantity of vaginal discharge dey change sake of di different stages of your menstrual cycle. E usually dey be like off white wey look creamy tint when your cycle wan start. Small-small, di amount of discharge go dey increase as you dey near ovulation. When ovulation start, di discharge go dey thick small and e go dey pull when you touch am. E dey recommended make women do Kegel exercises afta dem born pikin to strengthen di vaginal muscles again.  Kegels dey easy to do and you fit do am anywhere at any time.

If di political parties get structures wey go encourage and push womento contest and support dem to win, many of dem wey get di capacity and intelligence go come forward and make impact. ""Di way we dey do politics too gatz change. Politics need plenty money but wetin dem dey use di money do, no be to buy votes? If pipo realise say dat money dem collect dem dey sell dia future and right to good governance, tins go change. So we also need to change our orientation of wetin politics suppose be and support pipo wey get vision and capacity to serve cos politics na call to serve pipo not di oda way round.""

But tins don dey change. Women don dey speak out."" Austin Osakue, di Executive Director for Good Governance and Social Change for Benin City say di fact say only two women dey come out for govnor and two for deputy governor for di election show say women never start to take active politics seriously and di earlier pipo see am as challenge for evribodi, not just for women, na den tins fit begin change.

Few hours afta Nigeria election office, Inec declare di winner, some Nigerians enta social media to share funny memes wey show di death of  wetin dem describe as 'godfatherism'. Many of di memes  dey yab  former govnor Adams Oshiomhole on top how e fail to beat Obaseki despite all im actions to frustrate am for second term. E win di election wit 307,955 votes across 18 local goment while im main opponent, di APC candidate, Osagie  Ize Iyamu get 223,619 votes. Obaseki victory no come easy sake of di plenti  political battle between him and di former govnor Adams Oshiomhole wey try everytin to make sure say im no win di election. First, e deny am to win Nigeria ruling party APC primary wey lead to oga Obaseki to port alias defect in June to di kontri main opposition PDP to contest for di 19 September election. And oga Oshiomhole also make sure e campaign against Obaseki to deny am di chance to win im second term for office. But no be Oshiomhole AKA Oshio bab only dey fight Obaseki, days to di general election, one of APC national leader, Ahmed Tinubu bin do video dey ask Edo pipo make dem no vote am. Dis two APC leaders dem bin back  Obaseki during im first term election for 2016  sake of say na oga Oshiomhole bin bring am to power. Govnor Godwin Obaseki main campaign strategy and slogan na to end godfatherism (wey mean to allow one 'powerful politician to always decide who go become what, get goment appointment or win election) for Edo State - and im message really ginger di pipo wey don tire and want to stop political leaders for di state make dem stop to impose pesin wey dem like on dem. Dis na why many Nigerians dey celebrate di election victory of Godwin Obaseki as dem don create funny memes to condem godfatherism for Nigerian politics. Politics of godfatherism don tey inside Nigeria political space and many Nigerians believe say di kontri don gradually end dis practice wit di edo election but dis one na true? Anoda state wit plenti political drama between 'godfather and a sitting govnor na Akwa-Ibom State during di 2019 election. Oga Godswill Obot Akpabio bin dey in love wit former bank executive Udom Gabriel Emmanuel and make am Secretary to the State Government (SSG). E come support am to be come govnor but before im first term go finish, dem come begin to quarrel and dem later dem come draw di battle line as di 2019 election begin draw near. Akpabio bin decamp from PDP to APC and wage war against govnor Emmanuel to remove am. But despite im political clout and how e dey popular for di state, govnor Emmanuel beat APC and win di election. Many Nigerians still remember di drama wey bin happun between  governor Aminu Tambuwal and Aliyu Wamakko Wey make am defect to di PDP to contest for di 2019 govnorship election. Di need to control di APC party and leadership structure make Tambuwal to fall out of favour wit oga Wamakko wey be ogbonge political leader for Sokoto state. Oga Tambuwal win di govnorship election afta dem do supplementary election. No wonder immediately dem declare Obaseki winner e say Obaseki victory resemble how im too take win for Sokoto state. Di case no dey different for Benue state wia  political gbege between Govnor Samuel Ortom and George Akume  bin heat up di state. Di election na really between di two political leader as each of dem try to prove who get power pass. Oga Geoarge Akume wey be former govnor of di state and di APC leader of di state na im bring Smauel Ortom for power But close to di end of im first tenure dem come di kwata as oga accuse say di former govnor no allow work sake of plenti demand. E come decamp go PDP afta e discover say oga George don make up im mind to deny am di nomination. But afta di election, and di supplementary election, dem come declare am winner. For years di PDP reign supreme for Nigeria oil rich Rivers State until one man decide to test di foundations of di party for 2015 wen e decamp go di APC. Chibuike Amaechi govern Rivers State for eight years under di umbrella of di PDP, and during dat period e rise to di level of pesin wey sabi di political game even though technically na only one election im contest and win to be govnor of di Nigerian southern state. Im porting alias defection to di APC bin look like for di first time since democracy rule for Nigeria anoda party oda dan di PDP go rule Rivers State.

Amaechi side wit Dakuku Peterside under di umbrella of di APC to rival Wike, but in di end Wike win di 2015 govnorship election and win di 2019 election again. Even though some state govnors dem don dethrone dia godfather alias pipo wey bring dem to power, Nigerians believe say di Edo case go bring total end to  godfatherism especially as di kontri prepare to elect new leaders for 2023. Although dem dey optimistic, e no clear wen dis dia dream go come through.

sports	Togo national football team attack: Survivors remember machine gun ambush, 10 years afta	"On 8 January 2010, di Africa Cup of Nations for Angola bin only remain few days before e start. I bin dey di province of Cabinda, dey prepare to cover Group B for di BBC World Service, and bin also dey in charge of handing ova di BBC African Footballer of the Year trophy to di newly-crowned winner, Ivory Coast captain Didier Drogba. As di day waka dey go, unconfam reports of shooting, wey involve Togo national team, start to fly evriwia. Di detail bin no clear, but e clear say sometin serious don happun. How serious di tin be show wen I meet di squad as dem dey return to dia hotel for Cabinda city. I ask to speak to someone, dem immediately tell me say di team tok-tok pesin na dia best-known player - wey be Manchester City star Emmanuel Adebayor. Wen e siddon to tok, e give shocking details of di attack wey kill two members of di Togo delegation and result in life changing injuries to some odas. 10 years afta, dis na di tori from team members wey make global headlines and wetin happun afta. Togo squad bin dey in good spirits days before di 2010 Nations Cup. Dem just qualify back for di tournament afta dem miss out for 2008 and bin dey prepare to take on group wey feature some of di biggest names for African football - Drogba Ivory Coast and Michael Essien Ghana bin dey di same group. Before di tournament, Togo decide to camp for Pointe Noir for Republic of Congo, just over 100km from wia dem go play dia group games for Angola city of Cabinda. Cabinda dey separate from di rest of Angola, and instead of di Togo suad to fly from wia dem dey to di capital Luanda and den fly back north again, dem choose to drive. Dis decision later end with bad result. Afta di suqad relax in di evening, di night before - dem travel go di border. Players bin just dey laugh and joking amongst demselves for di bus. Angola security forces join dem for di border and suppose escort dem through di forest - wey be di base of one groups wey dey call for independence from Angola - to Cabinda city. Di squad no pay much attention to dia arrival.  Dem no know say very soon dem go begin fight for di lives of everyone inside di Togo team bus. Di small convoy move from di border, to di road through di forest. Looking back 10 years, midfielder Junior Senaya recall di journey, and di moment everitin change. ""All of us bin dey enjoy, afta we don cross di border. Some of us bin dey busy dey listen to music. I remember afta 15 minutes wey we don dey drive we hear gunshot for di forest - we all laugh, make joke. Den serious shooting start."" Di first casualty happen before anybody even know wetin dey go on. Senaya remember Togo media officer, Stanislas Ocloo, bin stand to video dia arrival for Angola at di moment of di attack. Dem shoot kill am. Anoda player wey remember clearly those crazy moments na goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale. Im life change for just few seconds, as e realise say dem don shoot am too. ""I hear di sound of di machine gun,"" Im tok, ""and for dat very moment I bin want move go hide, e bin dey as if dem nail me to chair. ""Dat na wen I see myself - both my belle and my back begin bleed. Dat na wen I begin panic. I say: 'Dem don hit me, help me, help me, I want see my daughter, my son. I no wan die here.'"" Even as im dey handle e own injuries, and fear, Obilale bin dey able to remember and tok wetin happun dat day. Im remember as assistant coach Amelete Abalo shout say dem don shoot am - di 54-year-na one of di pipo wey die for di attack. E remember one team-mate wey get military training call for weapon, so dat e go fit fight back. Di team bin no dey able to escape from di shooting because di bus driver - Mario Adjoua - don also wunjure for di start of di attack. Di convoy by-force stop, and serious firefight brake out between di attackers and di security forces. Memories of how long e last dey different, but everyone agree say na at least 30 minutes e last. Adebayor tok about how serious di longest half hour of e life dey. ""No be like say one or two guys shoot one or two times on our bus,"" Adebayor tell me afta im don dey safe place for di team hotel few hours afta di attack. ""We don dey di middle of dat for 30 minutes or even more. Our bus bin don stop and pipo bin don dey shoot our bus for 30 minutes. Can you imagine? Honestly na one of di worst experiences I don eva get for my life. ""Without di security den I no go dey here dey tok you. Maybe na my dead body you fit dey tok to."" Accounts of how e all end different - Adebayor describe one fleet of 4x4 vehicles arrive to take di squad away even as dem still dey shoot from di forest, while Senaya remember silence. But eventually dem take all of dem to hospital for di outskirts of Cabinda City, wia those wey noting do help carry dia dead and colleagues wey wunjure inside. ""Those na di times wey you realise wetin dey happun really, wen I take one of di players inside di hospital,"" Adebayor tok. ""Wen I come out, I see all di players, and everyone bin dey cry, everyone bin dey tok about dia family, calling pipo, calling dia mama, dey cry for phone. ""I think dat na di worst moment of dis day, because you fit see pipo tell dia last words, because dem think say dem go die."" Shortly afta dat di squad security men leave di squad on dia own wit few local officials. Wit dead and injured friends and colleagues for hospital, dem later walk short distance to dia hotel compound, without any security whatsoever. Dat na wia I come across dem, and I walk wit di team as dem waka go back dia accommodation. All four teams for di group bin dey stay for di same compound and Kolo Toure and couple of oda Ivorians come to offer condolences and find out wetin happen - rumours bin done already spread. Di survivors den sidon to eat - e bin dey late for evening, by dis point dem neva chop anytin since. Throughout di meal, evriwia bin dey silent. Di news of di attack make global headlines, and wia 24 hours earlier I bin dey able to walk in simply wit tournament accreditation, di next day heavy paramilitary security surround di hotel complex. Officials, goment ministers and representatives of di Confederation of African Football fly in from Angola capital Luanda, wit questions about wetin happen, who dey responsible, and why - for sometin wey go against tournament rules - Togo decide to drive instead of fly. Shortly afta di attack claim of responsibility comot from di Front for di Liberation of di Enclave of Cabinda, wey be separatist group wey never don accept di decision of di former colonial power, Portugal, to integrate Cabinda into Angola in di late 1950s. Several factions of di body bin dey, and which one dey responsible no dey clear - but e clear from very early on say dis no be attempted robbery. Anoda question lie for di presence Angolan security wey travel with di team. If Togo no dey authorised to drive to Cabinda, why and how come dem even get escort? And na di militarised escort cause di attack? None of dis questions get clear answers, even 10 years on - and at di time di most immediate issue for di players na to absorb wetin don happen to dem and decide wetin to do next. For several days e no dey clear to those of us wey watch from di outside wetin go happen. Rumours suggest say split bin dey between those for camp wey want continue wit di tournament and those wey want go home. In di end, Togolese authorities for Lome take decision, dem call di squad home to attend di funeral of those wey die and take part in ceremonies of national mourning - decision wey later make Caf ban dem sake of alleged ""government interference"" for football. Few days afta dia terrifying experience, Togo Sparrowhawks come out of dia hotel complex for anoda heavily armed convoy, dis time dem head towards Cabinda airport, and later leave. But di consequences of wetin happen no go easily leave di mind of those wey involve for di assault. Two pipo bin die and a number of odas seriously wound - di worst na di goalkeeper, Obilale. Initially tori spread say im die too. Dat no dey true, but e suffer serious damage to im spine, intestines, liver and bladder, and dem transfer am go hospital for South Africa, to begin e recovery. Since den e don face eight major operations and don get to rebuild e life, physically and emotionally. ""I done do lot of tins, and I happy say I do dem. I go back to school, take exams, work and write book,"" im tok. For long time im work wit children with special needs, as e help dem through di medium of football, and e don set up e own organisation to continue dat work. Obilale lose e livelihood - and almost e life - for Cabinda and e dey striking say im tok say na since only di change in leadership for di Confederation of African Football for 2017, wen current president Ahmad comot Issa Hayatou, na im e don get any meaningful contact wit di continental governing body. On Tuesday night Caf give am special award, 10 years from Cabinda, to recognise e achievement for im recovery, and wetin e dey do to help odas. Cameroon legend Samuel Eto'o na di host for Hurghada, and e be one of several former players wey don provide steady support. Odas na e former captain Adebayor and Ghana Ayew brothers - Andre Ayew and e brother Rahim bin dey part of di Black Stars squad wey play for Cabinda for 2010. Even those wey e no affect physically face significant challenges for di wake of di attack. Junior Senaya, wey be player wey help take Togo to dia remarkable first World Cup for Germany for 2006, bin dey only 25 wen e happen, but e football career end dat day. ""E bin dey psychologically catastrophic, e turn [tins] upside down,"" na so im tok. ""I really no fit recover... I find no reason at all to play football for my club because psychologically I bin dey shocked."" Now im dey study for e coaching badges. E last for half an hour, maybe a little more. Why and how e happen na still di subject of some dispute. But no one fit deny di human cost of dat short bus trip for Cabinda, 10 years ago.

sports	Israel Adesanya: Nigerian UFC 259 fighter fit become MMA legend?	"""For me na about di victories. Di names you collect, di scalps wey you take along di way. I wan be di guy wey take out everyone so that wen dem don tok finish dem go be like, 'na im be di greatest of all time.' Dose na di words of reigning UFC middleweight champion Israel ""Di Last Stylebender"" Adesanya. Di Nigeria-born New Zealand-based fighter bin dey tok ahead of e ogbonge fight against fearsome light heavyweight champion Jan Blachowicz, 38, wey be di headline fight of UFC 259 on 6 March. E go see di undefeated Adesenya, 31, make step up from middleweight as im attempt to become two-weight UFC champion. Irishman Conor McGregor na im be di first fighter for UFC history to win two titles afta e defeat Eddie Alvarez to add di lightweight title to e featherweight crown. Americans Daniel Cormier (light heavyweight and heavyweight) and Henry Cejudo (flyweight and bantamweight) as well as Brazilian Amanda Nunes (bantamweight and featherweight) come follow am afterwards. As Adesenya seek to join dis list of legends Nigerian MMA journalist Babatunde Koiki don explain to BBC Sport Africa wetin make Di Last Stylebender such a formidable fighter. Adesanya dey land one out of every two blows wey e attempt with either of e fists, elbows, knees or feet. Fighters wey land high percentage of dia strikes dey dey more efficient and waste less energy. And with e 80 inch arm reach coupled with e 44.5 inch leg reach for pesin wey get height of 6ft 4inches, Adesanya na nightmare from distance wit fearsome jabs. E dey take im time with e shots wey dey lead to decent 4.10 of significant punches wey e dey land per minute. Everything dey calculated. McGregor bin tok say: ""Precision dey beat power and timing dey beat speed"" dis na di perfect way to describe how Adesanya approach e fights. Pesin no dey record 15 MMA knockouts by accident. Adesanya don master di art of to dey manoeuvre im body away from attempted strikes by e opponents. Im dey absorb an average of 2.33 strikes per minute which, for tough sport like MMA, e dey pretty low. And e all dey down to im superb footwork, head movement and timing wey don help am dance out of range of one punch knockout specialists. Im also get di ability to avoid make im opponent dey take am down to di canvas wia some MMA fighters prefer to fight often as dem dey try force submissions, im don counter 86% of all attempts to put am down. Im sef no dey attempt takedowns, im dey clearly know say e success lie to dey do wetin im know how to do best: kicking and striking opponents into submission. Probably im biggest weapon na im mind. Pipo and e opponents don describe am as being cocky and arrogant. During verbal jousting sessions with e foes during pre-fight media events many don dey on di receiving end of e acidic wit and razor sharp tongue. Im social media barbs na one of a kind and e don manage to get under di skin and of many of those wey don to clash with am. Adesanya don back up every word with e fist for di octagon and im dey unbeaten."
