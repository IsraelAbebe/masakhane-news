business	Customers could get £100 for cutting energy use	"One energy supplier is predicting households could earn around £100 over the winter through a scheme to reduce peak-time energy use.
Octopus Energy said it expects to pay on average £4 each time a customer responds to a request to cut back.
National Grid will announce full details of the scheme, which can be adopted by all energy suppliers, later this month.
grid operator said some customers might get as much as £10 a day.
rsuade people to wait until later on to run their washing machine, tumble dryer, or dishwasher, and to not charge their electric car if demand is already high. 
me, set to start next month and run until March 2023, aims to help the UK avoid blackouts, by reducing energy consumption at peak times.
On Thursday National Grid warned homes could face three-hour rolling blackouts, if the UK is unable to secure enough gas and electricity imports, as demand rises over the colder months.
UK relies on gas to generate electricity, but the war in Ukraine has led to pressure on gas supplies across Europe.
Number Ten ruled out running a campaign being worked up by the business ministry to persuade households to consume less electricity.
But the National Grid is set to announce soon exactly how much it will pay per kilowatt hour for people cutting back when there is an acute shortfall in supply.
""Instead of cutting off whole chunks of the country if we are short of gas, we can reward people for using less energy at times of peak demand,"" Octopus chief executive Greg Jackson said.
k service will be available to homes that have smart meters installed, as long as their supplier is taking part in the scheme. There are about 14 million households with electricity smart meters in the UK.
Octopus Energy, which ran a trial of the scheme earlier this year, said there could be 25 days over the next six months when National Grid was willing to pay households to reduce their use.
Julie Byrne in Saffron Walden embraced the Octopus trial with gusto. She switched off lights, hung the towels outdoors to dry, turned the computer off, and even postponed dinner, despite her 25-year-old son rolling his eyes.
""Sometimes it was inconvenient,"" she says. ""But we worked round it.""
Her smart meter is outdoors so Julie didn't check which of her cut-backs was saving more, but she did see a small reduction in her next bill.
""It wasn't just the money. I felt I was helping,"" she said, though with the cost of living rising, she thinks, the payments are ""always going to be a plus.""
Customers who managed to cut back compared to their recent average electricity consumption would be rewarded with a payment, likely to be between £3 and £6 per kilowatt hour saved, Octopus said. 
mpensation rate was likely to be set higher on days when the energy shortfall was particularly severe, the firm said.
During Octopus' trial in February and March customers saved an average of 0.7 kilowatt hours, but were receiving much lower financial compensation, the firm said.
Under the National Grid-backed scheme, customers, including businesses, will receive an email or text a day ahead, outlining the time slot when they would be paid if they reduce their energy use, usually between 4pm and 7pm.
Mr Jackson believes the financial incentive, which is significantly higher than it was in the trial, will prove effective, noting that people regularly change their habits to make savings - even small ones.
""If you go to the supermarket and you buy stuff that's reduced to clear, you're saving less than a pound. People respond to that,"" said Mr Jackson. 
He believes there will be savings for the country as a whole as well. ""Today our system pays a fortune to have diesel and coal generation on standby.
""Every unit of energy that is saved will save on expensive standby diesel and coal.""

business	Energy bills: 'We cut back but are paying three times as much'	"Amy Appleyard had been paying £136 a month to heat and light her home.
Knowing that energy bills would rise in the autumn, she and her family had cut back on how much power they were using.
But they were shocked to be told that their monthly direct debit would rise more than three times to £442.
re just one of many UK households who have cut back on energy but are still being charged higher direct debits. But suppliers say bills have to reflect soaring energy prices.
It comes after Business Secretary Grant Shapps wrote to energy firms asking them to ensure bills reflected the amount of energy customers were using, and not to over-estimate charges. 
Mrs Appleyard, her husband Mike and eight-year-old daughter Kathryn, faced the huge hike in direct debit energy payments despite cutting back at their three-bedroom home in Greater Manchester.
""We've all become a bit more obsessive about turning off lights or unplugging chargers,"" Mrs Appleyard said.
""We also didn't put the heating on as early as usual this year, just maybe for an hour to warm the house through.""
She said her family's ""nightmare"" started because her supplier cut their monthly direct debit without telling them, so when it made its annual review of their monthly payments it led to a much bigger increase than usual.
""After spending hours on the phone, and being guaranteed that I would pay £200 monthly, and then seeing that £442 was still taking out of my account, I just burst into tears,"" she said.
Since then there have been more conversations and Mrs Appleyard said she hoped the situation will soon be sorted.
""We just want to pay for the gas and electricity we used but it's become very difficult,"" she said.
""I've been told that only £200 will be taken out of my account in December, but the situation is ongoing and has been horribly stressful.""
Meanwhile, Rory in South Wales said his direct debits had also gone up, while his energy use had gone down, so he ended up £1,400 in credit with his supplier.
He told Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show that he had asked to reduce his direct debit to a monthly amount he could afford but his supplier refused.
He said the direct debits have been increased to £481 even though his monthly usage has been nearer £300.
""I simply want to reduce it to an amount I can afford to pay and use the surplus to top up. I don't want to have all that money sitting there and me paying a ridiculous amount to the energy provider,"" he said.
Customers who pay gas and electricity bills by direct debit have the costs evened out over the year in a process known as smoothing.
m of smoothing is to avoid sudden bill shocks by spreading the cost over the whole year so even if you use a lot more energy in a winter month, you don't get a nasty surprise.
u get should be the actual amount you're charged for your energy. It is a combination of a standing daily charge plus your metered energy usage (your unit rate per kWh). 
It will change every month, depending on how much energy you use.
Suppliers encourage direct debit payments by offering customers a discount. They then estimate what your bills will be over the year, based on the price of gas and electricity and on your previous and predicted energy use.
Suppliers should ensure your direct debit payment is fair and proportionate to your usage.
If any customer ends up overpaying, they should be able to claim the extra amount back at the end of the year and maybe reduce their direct debits.
However rising energy costs - prices have doubled since last year - have left most people facing higher direct debits.
If your direct debit payments are regularly higher than your bills, you can challenge the amount with your supplier. 
Ask them to lower your monthly payments to reflect more accurately the amount of energy you actually use, based on your meter readings.
If they refuse you can make a complaint to your supplier and if you get no satisfaction you can escalate it to the Energy Ombudsman. 
Earlier this year, an Ofgem review of how energy firms were charging customers by direct debit revealed that about 500,000 households had seen their payments double, despite prices rising by 54%.
It told UK energy suppliers to review the way they charge customers by direct debit.
Ofgem said it had already called on firms to address the issue, but would be prepared to take further action if necessary.
At the weekend Mr Shapps told energy firms: ""I am interested to understand how you intend to ensure that your direct debit system does not over-estimate charging.""
Energy UK, the industry trade body, has said rising direct debits were inevitable as bills had to reflect the doubling in energy prices since last year.
Household energy costs are set to rise again next year which will mean further rises in direct debits.
government's energy price guarantee is being scaled back from April, when a typical household's annual bill will increase to £3,000."
business	Crown Resorts: Casino firm fined over illegal China dealings	"Australian gaming operator Crown Resorts has been fined A$80m ($57.4m; £45.6m) for illegally accepting Chinese bank cards at its casino in Melbourne.
Regulators say the transactions were falsely classified as hotel services.
r money laundering and excessive gambling casinos in Australia are not allowed to accept bank cards.
Crown acknowledged its ""historic failings"" and says its top executives were in the process of reforming how the company operates.
On Monday, the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission (VGCCC) said Crown had breached Australia's casino regulations by allowing gambling funds to be withdrawn using credit or debit cards.
regulator found that Crown had processed A$164m Australian dollars in China UnionPay card payments, drawing in A$32m of revenue in the process, between 2012 and 2016.
It said the transactions were falsely classified as ""services"" provided by the Crown Towers hotel in Melbourne.
However, patrons were given vouchers that could be exchanged for cash or chips at Crown's neighbouring casino.
According to the regulator, the ""clandestine"" scheme also allowed some Chinese nationals to spend more in foreign currencies than was allowed under Chinese law.
""Crown benefited handsomely from its illegal conduct,"" VGCCC chairwoman Fran Thorn said in a statement.
""The fine will ensure that Crown is stripped of the revenue it derived from the process and will send a clear message that it must comply with its regulatory obligations,"" Ms Thorn added.
In response, the gaming group said its board and senior management were ""committed to the delivery of a comprehensive reform and remediation programme to ensure Crown delivers a safe and responsible gaming environment"".
Crown - which operates integrated resorts in Melbourne, Perth and Sydney - is also under scrutiny from regulators who have alleged the company had knowingly dealt with criminal organisations then misled authorities about those dealings.
Its casino in Melbourne is currently only allowed to operate under the supervision of a government-appointed manager.

business	Energy bills: More help may be expected next year, says think tank	"government is likely to come under pressure to help households with soaring energy bills again next year, the Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank has warned.
IFS said calls for help were likely to continue for ""at least"" another year if oil and gas prices do not fall.
Energy bills are expected to keep rising until at least spring 2023.
But the government insisted the support package announced by the chancellor on Thursday was a ""temporary"" measure.
£15bn package means every UK household will get an energy bill discount of £400 from October, with further support for the poorest households, pensioners and disabled people.
w measures add to around £17bn of support already given by the government. This included one-off £150 council tax rebates for most homes in England and Wales and matched funding for the other devolved nations.
A steep rise in the cost of living, in particular a jump in energy prices in April, and a second one scheduled for October, had put growing pressure on the government to take action.
uncement, which came a day after the publication of Sue Gray's report into rule-breaking at Downing Street during the pandemic, was on a larger scale than many expected.
upport was broadly welcomed and described as a ""genuinely big package"" by the IFS. 
However, the think tank warned that it could prompt calls for additional support again next year, which in turn could contribute to further inflation.
""I think the biggest risk is that the chancellor will be tempted to do this again and again, and I think if that happens then we really could be in for a bit of trouble,"" IFS director Paul Johnson told the BBC's Today programme.
""He's got the most extraordinarily difficult decisions to make later this year on public sector pay, and then he'll be under pressure I suspect again this time next year when energy prices will still be high. 
""I think if he's tempted to continue putting money in to an economy where inflation is very high then that becomes a significant risk.""
Adam Scorer, chief executive of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, said the chancellor's measures averted ""the darkest of outcomes"" but warned ""millions will still be struggling and the energy crisis is far from over"".
He said a ""large, more targeted intervention is what was needed ahead of winter"", and said the government needed to plan for energy prices to remain high for some time. 
f living is set to continue to rise, with inflation - the rate at which prices go up - at a 40-year high and forecast to hit 10% later this year. 
Concerns have also been raised that the extra support for households could contribute to further inflation, by providing more spending power in the economy at a time when supply chains and the labour market are struggling to meet demand.
However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak insisted that his new measures would have a ""minimal impact"" on inflation.
Higher energy prices, caused in part by the war in Ukraine, have been a key factor driving inflation and analysts expect energy costs to remain high.
Cornwall Insight, has predicted the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, will be marginally higher in spring 2023 to around £2,818 than the price cap this autumn at £2,791. 
f the extra support for energy bills will be partly offset by a 25% additional tax on oil and gas firms' profits, which have soared in recent months.
Opposition parties had been calling for a windfall tax on energy firms for several months. 
A windfall tax is a one-off levy imposed by a government on a company. The idea is to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall.
Mr Sunak said the ""energy profits levy"" had been designed so it would ""incentivise and encourage investment"".
But Dan Atzori, research partner at Cornwall Insight, warned the tax came with ""risks to both investment and energy security"".
If windfall taxes were repeated over time, Mr Atzori said, it risked ""creating an unstable environment, and may lead to energy producers, who operate globally, investing and relocating to other areas"".
government had previously rejected the idea of a windfall tax on energy firms' profit, but Mr Sunak said with the sector ""making extraordinary profits"" he was ""sympathetic to the argument to tax those profits fairly"".
However, energy giant BP said while it knew ""how difficult things are for people"" Thursday's announcement was ""not for a one-off tax"" but a ""multi-year proposal"".
""Naturally we will now need to look at the impact of both the new levy and the tax relief on our North Sea investment plans,"" it said.
which represents oil and gas firms, Offshore Energies UK, said the levy would ""drive away"" investors and cut UK energy production."
business	UK faces worst downturn of any advanced economy, OECD says	"UK economy will suffer a bigger blow from the global energy crisis than other leading nations, according to international body the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
UK will contract by more than any other nation in the G7 group next year, it said.
Growth in the US and the eurozone will be weak, but Germany is the only other major economy expected to shrink.
OECD forecasts a ""significant growth slowdown"" globally in 2023.
ks to the strength of emerging economies, the world economy will grow by 2.2% next year, the OECD's latest report predicts.
But the war in Ukraine was affecting economies unevenly, the OECD said, with European countries bearing the brunt of the impact on business, trade and the spike in energy prices. 
G7 includes the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. While growth is expected to be weaker in most countries in the group, only Germany and the UK will contract, the OECD predicts.
OECD expects the UK's economyto shrink by 0.4% in 2023 to be followed by shallow growth of just 0.2% in 2024.
By contrast, last week the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted the UK would shrink by 1.4% next year, although it also predicted stronger growth, of 1.3% in 2024. The OBR said that would lead to the biggest drop in living standards on record.
Earlier this month the Bank of England predicted the downturn could last for two years.
Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to fall by 0.3%, the OECD report says.
Of the wider group of G20 countries, only Russia, which is subject to economic sanctions, is predicted to fare worse than the UK.
OECD, an intergovernmental body that focuses on economic policy, lays some of the blame for the UK's poor performance on the Energy Price Guarantee, the scheme to support household and business energy bills.
While subsidising energy bills reduces the immediate headline inflation rate, the OECD warns that it will add to overall demand in the economy, increasing inflationary pressures in the medium-term. That in turn would require the Bank of England to raise interest rates further and add to the cost of servicing debts.
""Better targeting of measures to cushion the impact of high energy prices would lower the budgetary cost, better-preserve incentives to save energy, and reduce the pressure on demand at a time of high inflation,"" it said.
UK government is moving away from universal support for energy bills after this winter, the prime minister's spokesman pointed out. 
""We're taking a different approach post-April to the energy support, targeting it towards the most vulnerable,"" he said.
In response to the OECD's forecast for the economy, he said this year the UK was forecast to be the fastest growing economy in the G7.
""These are challenges that are affecting different countries at slightly different times,"" he said. 
""We emerged from the pandemic faster than many other countries in Europe. But some of these challenges are shared,"" he said. 
Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said: ""We are forecast to be the only OECD economy that will be smaller in 2024 than it was in 2019.
""This is the Tory doom loop. A low growth spiral leading to higher taxes, lower investment, squeezed wages and poor public services.""
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney described the OECD forecast as a ""damning verdict"" and said a succession of Conservative chancellors this year had wrecked hope of growth.
OECD said UK inflation - which hit a 41-year high of 11.1% in October - is likely to peak at the end of this year but remain above 9% in early 2023, slowing to 4.5% by the end of next year.
rganisation expects UK interest rates to rise from their current level of 3% to 4.5% next April and unemployment to rise to 5% by the end of 2024. 
f paying for help with energy bills showed up on the government's accounts in October, as households began receiving the first tranche of a £400 subsidy, and the lower £2,500 energy price cap came into effect.
Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that these schemes together cost £3.4bn in October.
ushed up government borrowing - the difference between government spending and tax income - to £13.5bn last month, the ONS said.
Although the figure was £4.4bn higher than last year it was lower than analysts had expected.
ONS said that borrowing in the financial year to date - covering April to October 2022 - was £84.4bn, although this was £21.7bn less than in the same period last year."
business	Royal Mail staff call off planned strike action	"Planned strikes by Royal Mail workers in the next two weeks have been called off after a challenge by the firm.
Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) are involved in a dispute over pay and conditions.
CWU said it had decided to withdraw industrial action notices for the next fortnight following a legal letter from Royal Mail.
A series of strikes have taken place in recent weeks and action will now resume on Saturday 12 November.
CWU general secretary Dave Ward said: ""We recognise the deep frustration felt by many members over this decision.""
rike action involves more than 115,000 workers, the union said.
CWU has been locked in a long-running dispute with the company around pay increases keeping up with the soaring cost of living and working practices.
median pay at Royal Mail is £32,465 a year, with the average pay for a postal delivery worker lower than that at £25,777. 
Royal Mail has blamed strike action for rising losses and job cuts, as well as lower volumes of parcels being posted.
""The fact remains that the current direction of Royal Mail doesn't benefit the company, the community or the country,"" Mr Ward added.
""We still need to secure a decent future of this industry, and no attempts to attack our union and our members will change our determination in fighting for that.""
Royal Mail confirmed that the CWU had withdrawn planned strike action originally planned for 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10 November.
""The CWU has withdrawn strike action following Royal Mail writing to CWU to highlight numerous material concerns with the formal notification of planned rolling strike action,"" a spokesperson said.
mpany and the CWU are due to attend scheduled talks at the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) on Monday.
""We will continue to do all we can to keep business, companies and the country connected,"" the Royal Mail spokesperson added.
Royal Mail said strike action cost the business £70m during the first half of its financial year, leading to an operating loss of £219m, compared to a £235m profit last year.
It has been attempting to make the company a ""parcels-led"" business as the number of letters being sent through the post declines and more people shop online."

""The executives of companies that operate such plants also have a huge responsibility on them that is incomparable with other companies.""

Fukushima nuclear disaster happened on 11 March 2011 when a massive earthquake off north-east Japan triggered a tsunami which led to a nuclear meltdown.
It was the worst nuclear power incident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, but has been considered less damaging to local people because far lower quantities of radioactive iodine were released.
No one was killed in the disaster, but the long-term effects of the radiation remain a matter of debate.

rease is pencilled in for April 2023, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).
Fuel duty is a tax motorists pay when buying fuels such as petrol and diesel.
It could go up by 23% in April, according to the OBR, which provides independent checks of the government's economic plans.
would be ""the largest rise in the fuel duty rate in history"", it said.
12p per litre rise across petrol and diesel prices would be expected to bring in about £5.7bn in extra taxes.
We don't know yet. 
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the government has not made a decision to hike fuel duty.
He said that ""is not government policy"" and that the Treasury would ""make a decision on that at the next Budget in the spring"".
Speaking after the fuel duty rise was included in the OBR's review of the government's Autumn Statement, he said: ""That was just an assumption that the OBR made.""
So, it is still possible the duty could be frozen or go up by a different amount.
In theory, fuel duty should go up every year.
However, in March, Rishi Sunak - who was chancellor at the time - used the government's Spring Statement to cut the tax, following concerns about rising prices.
Fuel duty on petrol and diesel was reduced by 5p, from 58p to 53p, for 12 months.
OBR's statement assumes that 5p cut will end as planned in March.
It has also factored in a scheduled rise of 7p on top of that.
However, chancellors do not always go ahead with increases to fuel duty.
Before Mr Sunak reduced it, the tax had been frozen since 2011.
Fuel duty goes into the government's general spending pot.
And it's a big money-spinner, tending to raise about £28bn a year.
reasury said the 5p cut introduced in March would cost the public purse £2.4bn in 2022/23.
For 2022-23, the OBR expects fuel duties to raise £26.2bn in total.
re's also a question mark over how the government will make up the shortfall in the tax as more people start to drive electric cars.
However, the Treasury will also start charging vehicle excise duty on them from 2025.
Petrol and diesel prices have been on a rollercoaster ride this year.
Recent data puts petrol at an average of 164p per litre on UK forecourts. 
's a few pennies below the level it was at the Spring Statement when fuel duty was cut.
A wide gap has opened up between petrol and diesel, which is now at an average of 188p - about 8p higher than in March. 
After the fuel duty cut in March, prices came down a bit - only to shoot up to record highs in the summer.

Fuel prices in the UK move together with changes in the price of crude oil - which it is made from.
re also affected by the exchange rate between the pound and dollar, as crude oil is traded in dollars. A weaker pound means fuel gets more expensive.
Prices were rising before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the fallout made fuel more expensive.

US has banned all imports of Russian oil. The UK is phasing it out, and EU sanctions will block most Russian oil imports after 5 December."

""Fast-rising rents are not offering any relief and could keep some buyers in the hunt for a home for longer than they would like,"" said Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor,
""Even though the housing market is slowing, it is nowhere near a crash. Strong demand for homes far outstripping available housing inventory means the housing market remains a difficult one for wannabe homeowners and those looking to climb up the property ladder.""
Nationwide is predicting that an increase in energy costs and rising mortgage interest rates will add to the pressure on household budgets in the coming months.
It suggested that the least energy efficient property could typically see bills surge by £2,700 a year, or £225 a month.
""There are signs that the housing market is losing some momentum,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist.
""We expect the market to slow further as pressure on household budgets intensifies in the coming quarters, with inflation set remain in double digits into next year.

mpany said it remained ""focused on taking care of our Russian-based associates"" and had been supporting individuals in Ukraine and Russia to secure employment with Marriott outside countries affected by the conflict. 
""We continue to join our associates and millions of people around the world in wishing for an end to the current violence and the start of a path towards peace,"" it added. 
Marriott joins McDonald's, Starbucks and other companies in heading for the exits in recent weeks as the war in Ukraine continues and Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically tighten.
Public outcry over Vladimir Putin's invasion also put pressure on Western brands to distance themselves. Hotel brands drew attention for being among the slowest to respond.
""The process to suspend operations in a market where Marriott has operated for 25 years is complex,"" the company said in a statement.
Marriott did not provide further details about its exit.

business	Argentina rate hiked to 69.5% as inflation hits 20-year high	"Argentina's central bank has raised its main rate of interest to 69.5% as it tries to contain soaring inflation.
k put up its 28-day benchmark rate by 9.5% percentage points, its second hike in as many weeks.
It comes as new figures showed inflation in the country had hit a 20-year high of over 70%.
umbers dashed hopes that price rises had peaked after the latest US data showed that inflation had eased.
""The rise in the policy rate will help reduce inflation expectations for the remainder of the year,"" the bank said in a statement.
move came after the bank raised the rate by 8 percentage points two weeks ago and marks its eighth hike this year.
untry's inflation rate is forecast to top 90% by the end of the year.
Controlling soaring prices, tackling high debt levels and reining in government spending in South America's second largest economy are at the top of the agenda for Argentina's latest economy minister, Sergio Massa.
Mr Massa, who is the third person to hold the post since early last month, aims to calm inflation using a more conventional approach than his predecessors.
Along with raising interest rates, he has pledged to not call on the central bank to print more money this year to fund government spending.
In July, Martín Guzmán resigned as finance minister after being in the role for more than two and a half years. His successor Silvina Batakis lasted just a month in the post.
Earlier this year, Argentina avoided defaulting on a $44bn International Monetary Fund loan.
However, the impact of measures the government has to implement to meet the conditions of the deal is a major cause of concern for many in the country.
In recent weeks, protestors have taken to the streets of the capital Buenos Aires to demonstrate against President Alberto Fernández' handling of the economy.

business	Energy firms must offer more help on bill payments, Ofgem warns	"Most of the UK's energy suppliers must improve how they help people who are struggling to pay their bills, watchdog Ofgem has said. 
Its review found failures in firms being able to identify which customers were having payment difficulties and a lack of help with payment plans.
government has stepped in to cap a typical household energy bill at £2,500 a year until 2024 but this is still unaffordable for many customers.
rise comes in on 1 October.
Campaigners have warned millions of people will still face fuel poverty this winter, despite Prime Minister Liz Truss' multi-billion pound plan to ease the impact of higher gas and electricity bills.
A household is considered to be in fuel poverty if it has to spend 10% or more of its income on energy.
If you are struggling to afford your gas and electricity bills, Citizens Advice recommends contacting your supplier directly and offering to come up with a payment plan.
Energy suppliers must offer payment plans that customers can afford, under Ofgem rules. In addition, those on pre-payment meters who do not have the money to top them up can ask for emergency credit.
Citizens Advice said that by the end of August its frontline staff had supported more than 15,000 people who were unable to top up their prepayment meter.
rity's chief executive, Dame Clare Moriarty, said Ofgem's review showed some energy companies were ""falling drastically short of the mark"". 
""This is utterly unacceptable given the huge cost-of-living pressures people are facing,"" she said. ""Suppliers need to up their game and Ofgem needs to hold them to task.""
Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said its review found some suppliers had fallen short of the standards expected by the watchdog and urged them to ""step up"".
""Although the government's package of support will provide some welcome relief, it's critical that, going into this tough winter, energy companies prioritise the needs of vulnerable customers struggling to pay their bills,"" he said.

All the energy companies identified have been asked to submit information to Ofgem to set out how they will improve their service.
Ofgem said it had already issued provisional orders to Utilita and ScottishPower, meaning they must take specific and urgent actions.
A ScottishPower spokesperson said: ""We're disappointed that all of the effort our staff make to help our customers manage affordability challenges has resulted in this conclusion from Ofgem.
""We will now work with Ofgem to implement their recommendations.""
A Utilita spokesperson said the company was ""very disappointed"" about Ofgem's ""decision to issue a provisional order rather than to engage with us"". 
""Our staff are deeply committed to helping customers through the cost-of-living crisis and the financial support we offer is extensive: In 2022 alone, we will provide financial assistance more than a million times to customers who need our help,"" it added."
business	Pulsic takeover by Super Orange HK blocked on security grounds	"UK has blocked the takeover of an electronic design company by a Hong Kong firm because of concerns over risks to national security.
Super Orange HK had sought to acquire Bristol-based Pulsic. 
But the government said there was the potential for tools to be exploited ""to build defence or technological capabilities"". 
Chinese embassy said the UK should provide a fair and ""non-discriminatory environment"" for Chinese businesses. 
move is the latest attempt to limit Chinese involvement in British businesses and technology. 
In 2020, Chinese mobile provider Huawei was banned from the UK's 5G infrastructure over national security concerns, which were denied by the company. 
government is also reviewing a Chinese-backed takeover of Newport Wafer Fab, Britain's largest microchip factory. 
keover attempt was blocked under the National Security and Investment Act, which came into force in January. 
It gives the government powers to scrutinise and intervene in business transactions to protect national security.
Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the software developed by Pulsic could be used ""to facilitate the building of cutting-edge integrated circuits that could be used in a civilian or military supply chain"". 
It said the decision to block the takeover was ""necessary and proportionate to mitigate the risk to national security"". 
Chinese embassy in the UK said: ""Any abuse of national security review will only damage the UK's investment environment and long-term interests.""
Pulsic, which has offices in Bristol, Newcastle, Tokyo and San Jose, has not yet responded to a request for comment. 
Super Orange HK could not be reached for comment. The Chinese Embassy in the UK has been contacted for comment. 
Conservative leadership favourite Liz Truss has said Beijing's ""increasing assertiveness"" is a ""deep security concern"". 
""We should look at making sure we're not exporting technology that can be used against us. We need to clear investment screening and we've developed that to make sure that we can't have acquisitions of key strategic assets,"" the foreign secretary told a leadership hustings on Wednesday. 
She has also said the UK should be cracking down on Chinese-owned companies such as social media platform TikTok. "
business	Cost of living: Lessons from history about how we spend	"In 1967, in a field near the village of Cridling Stubbs in North Yorkshire, a pot containing more than 3,300 Roman coins was unearthed.
rd of copper coins from the 300s AD were still in the jar, buried upright, with a makeshift lid on top.
""We do not know for certain why they were buried there, and why nobody ever came back to find them,"" says Kat Baxter, Leeds Museums and Galleries' curator of archaeology and numismatics.
""That is the beauty of them - we do not know the answers. It is very mysterious.""
We may not have the answers, but there are theories. The coins not only help us think about what wealthy people were doing with their cash nearly 2,000 years ago but may also frame some of the debate about the cost of living and cash today.
Cridling Stubbs hoard may have been buried for religious reasons, as some kind of offering to the gods. 
Another possibility, is that it was hidden somewhere thought to be safe in a time before banks and building societies, particularly if the owners felt their money might be taken during a time of conflict.
""These were the security worries of the time. We have the same worries today but they just take a different form,"" Ms Baxter says.
Fraudsters steal £4m a day from people in the UK, so protection against such cons is high on the agenda for the finance industry and its customers.
Cridling Stubbs hoard is among more than 400 objects on display at the Money Talks exhibition, which runs at Leeds City Museum until 26 June.
As well as money security, the exhibits explore subjects including how money has been used in toys and play, the evolution of banking, and different examples of currency used around the world.
""Everyone has a relationship with money in some way,"" Ms Baxter says.
Our relationship with money is being tested at present, not only through the rising cost of living, but also in the changing way we pay for things.
Since 2015, according to the consumer group Which?, some 4,685 bank branches have shut their doors.
A further 226 are already scheduled to close by the end of the year, it says, while the rate of closures in rural areas has outstripped those in urban areas.
People are increasingly using their smartphones and computers to manage their finances. Cards are now a much more common method of transaction than notes and coins.
However, Which? has warned that a move to a cashless society would leave millions of people ""cut adrift"". The government declared in the most recent Queen's Speech that it would legislate to ensure people had access to cash withdrawal and deposit facilities within a reasonable distance of home.
xhibition in Leeds confirms there are plenty of examples through history of changing ways of paying for things.
ke, for example, the kind of items used as currency. In one display case sits a finely polished and ground axe head. It was probably never used to chop anything, but would have been used in some kind of transaction - a bit like bartering.
Ms Baxter points out that there would be a wider cultural impact if notes and coins were to disappear entirely.
One part of the exhibition examines how cash is used as a lucky charm in many ways - from popping it into the shoe of a new bride, to embedding it into necklaces.
""Going cashless does not just mean losing physical coins, it means losing a number of traditions too,"" she says.
Less of a charm and more of a convenience is the way payment is often embedded into the things we wear and carry nowadays.
Using a smartphone or a watch, many of us will routinely tap to pay for items, or a bus or train fare, 
Perhaps we are happy to lose some of the traditions and physicality of cash?
A recent survey by the card issuing platform, Marqeta, found that 77% of respondents aged 18 to 24 were confident enough in contactless payments to leave their wallet at home and go out with just their phone.
""While the pandemic was the catalyst for the shift to contactless and mobile wallets, it is the convenience, security, and speed of these payment options that have made them sticky,"" says Anna Porra, Marqeta's European strategy director.
Although she says these so-called intelligent mobile wallets are still in their infancy.
Diners are already paying at a restaurant by scanning a QR code on their phone at the table and settling the bill, without ever having to call over a waiter. Soon, she says, we will be standing at a bus stop and scanning QR codes for something we might be able to buy nearby.
most significant developments will come, she suggests, when our devices not only act as a payment mechanism but also use artificial intelligence to prompt us with ways to manage our finances.
merging of payments and financial services could even give information to businesses of our worthiness to buy something on credit, and guide consumers on the way to pay and whether it is affordable.
So-called super apps in the US and China already branch out into identifying what financial products might be available to consumers, as well as providing other services such as food, hotels and taxi options.
Ms Porra says widespread adoption of intelligent wallets will only come if providers also offer widespread education, to ensure users can be confident and have control over what is being suggested.
So, in the end it comes back to trust and security - not so different to the thought processes of someone burying a pot of coins in North Yorkshire nearly 2,000 years ago."
business	Business energy prices to be cut by half expected levels	"Energy bills for UK businesses will be cut by around half their expected level this winter under a huge government support package.
me will fix wholesale gas and electricity prices for firms for six months from 1 October, shielding businesses from crippling costs.
Hospitals, schools and charities will also get help, the government said.
It comes after ministers announced a multi-billion pound plan to help households with bills for two years.
Analysts suggest the help for firms and households combined could cost up to £150bn.
Industry groups welcomed the package but warned further support may be needed after the winter.
It is understood the scheme will be reviewed after three months with an option to extend support for ""vulnerable businesses"" - but it is not known what sectors come under the category.
Wholesale prices, which are what suppliers pay for energy in bulk before they distribute it to customers, are expected to be fixed for all non-domestic energy customers at £211 per MWh for electricity and £75 per MWh for gas. 
rates will be the base cost, to which other add-ons, such as standing charges will be added by suppliers.
Independent analysts Cornwall Insight said the plan marked a ""substantial"" 45% discount on wholesale energy prices at the end of last week. 
government said the scheme would apply to companies which had agreed fixed deals at higher prices on or after 1 April, when energy bills started to surge. Those on variable and flexible tariffs will also be eligible.
Companies do not need to contact suppliers as the discount will automatically be applied to their bills, with savings seen from October but received from November.
Josh Farrant, manager at The Ye Olde Fleece Inn in Kendal, Cumbria, said the pub was facing a hike in energy bills from £44,000 to around £124,000 a year before the government's wholesale cap was announced.
""That some help is coming gives us a bit of hope,"" he said. ""But we are still massively going to have to look at the way we do things.""
""It doesn't mean the panic is over. It's going to run for six months, then we'll see.""
Guy Adams, who runs the Isle of Barra Beach Hotel in the Hebrides, said he had been quoted a 377% increase in his energy bills before the cap, which ""would probably have finished us off"".
""At present our cheapest room rate is £110 per night. We would have had to raise that to £415 per night,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.
However, he said because his seasonal hotel will close for the winter and reopen in May, it was ""absolutely impossible"" to set prices for bookings given the support package will only run until April.
""The fact that it is going to be reviewed in six months is not practical,"" he added.
Prime Minister Liz Truss said the government understood the ""huge pressure"" businesses, charities and public sector organisations faced with bills. She added that the new scheme would provide ""certainty and peace of mind"".
Bur Labour business spokesman Jonathan Reynolds said there were still questions about ""how much this will cost and who will pay for it"".
Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said the ""delayed announcement"" left businesses ""under a cloud of damaging uncertainty"". 
""The government have no plan beyond these next six months, paralysing businesses who need to make decisions for the long term,"" she added.
upport will apply to all non-domestic energy customers in England, Scotland and Wales. A scheme offering comparable support will be established in Northern Ireland.
Officials have not said how much the package will cost the taxpayer, but Cornwall Insight estimates it at around £25bn. 
Energy-intensive industries, such as steel-making, have warned that businesses could go bust due to their energy costs, which have surged since Russia invaded Ukraine.
Unlike households, businesses are not covered by an energy price cap, which is the maximum amount a supplier can charge per unit of energy. It means non-domestic bills have soared even higher.
government announced earlier this month that bills for a typical household would be limited to £2,500 annually until 2024 under a separate scheme.
On Wednesday, it also said:
g problem with this support for business is its shelf life. Few businesses plan with only a six-month time horizon and there will be some whose plans to cut production, close premises and let staff go will not change as a result of this intervention.  
But many others - particularly those in retail and hospitality - may see this giving them a fighting chance over the commercially crucial Christmas trading period.
government has thrown an emergency blanket over the economy this winter, but longer term, more fundamental reform to the energy supply market, its pricing and mechanics will be needed.
Developing more cheap renewables, securing foreign supplies of liquid gas, drilling for more domestic fossil fuels, breaking the link between gas prices and electricity and pushing ahead with hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and small and large scale nuclear have been part of the government's plan for nearly two years. 
What's new is the pressure applied by Vladimir Putin to do it as fast as possible. 
Stephen Phipson of Make UK, which represents manufacturers, said businesses would ""warmly welcome"" the government support package.
""Government has delivered a scheme which is simple to understand, giving reassurance to the business sector and making immediately available the much-needed help companies have been calling for across the board.""
However, he warned that energy prices were likely to remain high for more than six months and firms may need ""support for a longer period if we are to protect jobs and remain competitive"". 
Director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said the price cap would give steelmakers ""the chance to get through the winter"". But he called on the government to ""rapidly reform the energy market to ensure longer-term competitive prices"".
Smaller businesses have also been struggling with rising bills, with brewery bosses warning that pubs and restaurants could be forced to close after energy costs soared by as much as 300%.
A landlord of one Essex pub told the BBC his energy bill had risen from about £13,000 a year to £35,000.
Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said the industry was ""relieved"" by the support ahead of the busy Christmas trading period, adding it would secure jobs.
What questions do you have about the new support package for businesses?"
business	Mortgage rates rise sharply as squeeze tightens	"Major mortgage lenders are increasing the cost of home loans, with the average two-year fixed rate now close to 6%, new figures show.
A typical two-year fixed mortgage deal is currently 5.75%, up from 4.74% on the day of the mini-budget, financial information service Moneyfacts said.
Lenders have been scrambling to reprice deals after the pound's fall fuelled forecasts of higher interest rates.
Mortgage rates have climbed since December as interest rates have risen.
In December, the average two-year fixed deal was 2.34%.
Fixed deal interest rates do not change during the term of the mortgage, so rates are quoted for new or renewing borrowers.
Lenders have also withdrawn hundreds of products in recent days, which may leave some borrowers with difficulties securing a deal. 
recently re-priced deals have tended to be from major lenders who want relatively low-risk borrowers. Those homeowners who have high debt levels, or who may have missed repayments on credit, may find their choice is much more limited in the short-term.
Brokers say there is still money available for mortgage providers to lend, but the days of ultra-low rates - typical of the last decade - have quickly disappeared.
""We did not expect that to happen quite so rapidly,"" one broker said.
Mortgage rates have been rising ever since the Bank of England began a series of seven consecutive rises in the Bank rate - the benchmark figure of interest rates. Rates then jumped after the mini-budget prompted widespread expectation of a faster and higher jump in the Bank rate in the coming months.
Lenders look at the long-term cost of borrowing, and potential demand, and try to stay a step ahead of the Bank of England when setting the rates for fixed rate deals.
Roughly 100,000 people a month come to the end of a fixed deal and often remortgage, while first-time buyers also sign up to fixed deals. The 1.5 million homeowners on variable or tracker deals often see their costs rise in direct response to a Bank rate rise.
A typical five-year fixed deal has been slightly cheaper than a two-year fixed deal for some time - but both are now seeing rates rise sharply.
""The normal rules of lending have changed,"" said Aaron Strutt of Trinity Financial.
Halifax - the UK's biggest mortgage lender - said it would launch its new, higher rates on Wednesday. 
""The new rates reflect the continued increase in mortgage market pricing over recent weeks,"" a spokesperson for Halifax said.
In recent days, other major lenders such as NatWest, Nationwide and Virgin Money have increased their rates.
NatWest did so on Sunday, a highly unusual day of the week to make a change, according to brokers, signalling the speed at which the market is changing.
A homeowner borrowing £200,000 on a 30-year mortgage may have been looking at a rate of 3.5% and a monthly repayment of £898 just over a week ago. Now, there are more likely to be facing a 5.5% rate and a monthly repayment of £1,135.
As always, there is uncertainty over the longer-term trend for mortgage rates. People will have to consider how much they can borrow, and what lenders will judge them to be able to afford.
Amid the turmoil of last week, lenders pulled deals off the shelf at unprecedented levels, with brokers saying deals were lasting for a very short period of time as people flooded them and lenders with enquiries.
Moneyfacts said that there were 3,961 deals available on the morning of the mini-budget, compared with 2,262 at the start of this week - a 43% fall. Products were last withdrawn quickly at the start of the pandemic, but not at such a level.
Many of deals were withdrawn by smaller, more specialist lenders. That may create added uncertainty for those with more chequered borrowing histories.

business	UK inflation rises at fastest rate for 40 years as food costs jump	"Prices are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for 40 years with food costs, particularly for bread, cereal and meat, climbing.
UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, edged up to 9.1% in the 12 months to May, from 9% in April, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
Fuel and energy prices are the biggest drivers of inflation, but the ONS said food costs had pushed it up further.
Workers and unions are pushing for pay rises to cope with higher prices.
But the government has warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s style ""inflationary spiral"" where firms hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers through higher prices.
Currently, inflation is at the highest level since March 1982, when it also stood at 9.1% and the Bank of England has warned it will reach 11% this year.
Inflation is the pace at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs £1 and that rises by 5p compared with a year earlier, then milk inflation is 5%.
In a BBC-commissioned survey of more than 4,000 people, 82% said they thought their wages should increase to match the rising price of goods and services.
Households were hit by an unprecedented £700-a-year increase in energy costs in April, and fuel price rises in June mean it costs more than £100 to fill an average family car with petrol.
Rail workers walked out on Tuesday causing severe disruption, with further strikes planned for Thursday and Saturday in a dispute over pay, jobs and conditions.
Rail, Maritime and Transport union is calling for a pay rise of 7%, while employers have offered a maximum of 3%.
Unison, which represents public sector workers, accused ministers of ""living on another planet"" over ""talks of public sector pay restraint"".
""Under-pressure health, care, school and council services desperately need staff to be given a pay boost that matches runaway prices,"" assistant general secretary Jon Richards said.
ggest teachers' union is also warning of potential industrial action over pay.
National Education Union has criticised government proposals for a 3% pay increase for most teachers in England, and called for an ""inflation-plus increase for all teachers"".
But Dominic Raab told the BBC's Today programme: ""We have got to stop making the problem worse by fuelling pay demands that will only see inflation stay higher for longer and that only hurts the poorest the worst.""
ONS said rising prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages helped fuel inflation in May.
Russia's war in Ukraine has severely restricted wheat and maize supplies, which are used to make bread and cereals, from two of the world's biggest exporters.
Ukraine is also a major producer of sunflower oil, meaning the costs of alternatives have also climbed.
Market research firm Kantar has forecast that the average annual grocery bill in the UK is set to rise by £380 this year.
Supermarket Asda told the BBC some shoppers are setting £30 limits at checkouts and petrol pumps, with customers putting less in their baskets and switching to budget ranges.
Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said ""widespread food price rises"" meant the cost of goods leaving factories had risen at their fastest rate in 45 years in May, with the cost of raw materials at the highest on record.
But he said the steep rises in food and record high petrol prices in May had been stemmed by the price of clothes rising less than they did this time last year, along with a drop in computer game costs.
ONS also revealed average UK house prices increased by 12.4% in the year to April, with average prices now £281,000, £31,000 higher than this time last year.
Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, said after families paid for essentials, ""the amount of spare cash left over to spending on days out, socialising and other treats is shrinking at an astonishing rate"".
Mum Georgia, from Birmingham, said she was having to cut back on trips with her daughter Harper-Faye as a result of prices rises.
""I haven't got the money to go to Sea Life Centres and stuff. That's like, £25 a ticket,"" said she said. ""I can't go out as much as I used to, not a chance. I can't afford it.""
Responding to the latest inflation rate, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was ""using all the tools at our disposal to bring inflation down and combat rising prices"".
government has provided a  package of measures, worth £15bn in total, to help people cope with soaring prices.
But Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor said the country needed ""more than sticking plasters to get us back on course - we need a stronger, and more secure economy"". 
Liberal Democrat treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine called for a cut in VAT, adding: ""This chancellor has hiked taxes time and time again, refusing to slash them to help with the cost of living emergency.""
re's no respite from the relentless rise in prices. While at least the rate of rise in inflation appears to have slowed, this is just a pause for breath. Further records in petrol prices and a renewed surge in the price of internationally traded gas after a fire at a key US gas terminal, mean a hot summer, and tricky autumn.
Right now we are also seeing the impact of a notable fall in sterling, compounding the global inflationary pressures, and helping to explain why UK inflation is higher than the rest of the G7.
Inflation this high is disastrous for the personal finances of millions of households, especially as food prices are unarguably surging. ""Squeeze"" doesn't quite capture how some working families are seeing their entire disposable income wiped out by monthly energy direct debits, or turning up at supermarkets asking the cashiers to stop the till at £30 or £40.
Bank of England may not see this data as a reason to ""act forcefully"" which many see as code for a half a per cent rise in August. They will continue to watch the evolution of wage settlements. While there is little evidence of a spiral in wages and prices so far, it is clear we are at a critical moment for the jobs market. 
With vacancies at record levels, unions see a one-off opportunity to increase wages, and will continue to push for double digit rises, for example rejecting Rolls Royce's £2,000 cost of living payment. Employers including the government will resist, but workers may find some wind in their sails in negotiations.
One way to try to control how fast prices are rising is to raise interest rates. The aim of this is to increase the cost of borrowing and encourage people to borrow and spend less, and save more.
In a bid to stem the pace of soaring prices, the Bank of England recently increased UK interest rates from 1% to 1.25%.

business	More mortgage lenders pull deals on rate rise fears	"Santander and Yorkshire Building Society have now suspended mortgage deals after a fall in the pound fuelled forecasts of rising interest rates.
A number of lenders have temporarily halted mortgage offers for new customers.
Meanwhile, Nationwide said it will lift rates on a range of fixed mortgages.
On Tuesday, the Bank of England's chief economist said that action would have to be taken - an indication that interest rates could rise sharply.
In a speech, Huw Pill said: ""I think it is hard not to draw the conclusion that all this will require a significant monetary policy response.""
Economists now expect interest rates to more than double to 5.8% by April, from the current level of 2.25%. Interest rates had previously been forecast to hit 4% by next May.
Lenders that are suspending mortgage offers for new customers include HSBC, Santander, Post Office, Skipton Building Society and Virgin Money.
Lucian Cook, head of residential research at estate agency Savills, said fixed-rate mortgages were ""incredibly difficult to price at the moment"" because there is a lack of certainty over interest rates. 
umber of residential mortgages on offer by lenders fell to 3,596 on Tuesday, compared with 3,961 deals on Friday when the government announced a mini-budget, according to financial information firm Moneyfacts.
Julie-Ann Haines, chief executive at Principality Building Society, said lenders had to ""stress-test"" mortgages to make sure that if the Bank of England base rates go up customers can still afford their monthly payments.
She said the reason mortgage rates were going up quite quickly in recent months was because banks and building societies have to be able to make a margin.
Economists began forecasting a hike in interest rates when the pound plunged against the dollar on Monday.
me after Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng pledged more tax cuts on top of a £45bn package he had already announced at a ""mini-budget"" on Friday.
Bank of England issued a statement on Monday saying that it would ""not hesitate"" to raise interest rates after the pound hit record lows.
Overnight, the pound stabilised at $1.08 but is still at its lowest level against the dollar for 37 years.
Sales assistant Robin Price, who is on the minimum wage, has been saving up his mortgage deposit for years and thanks to that and an inheritance, is now ready to buy. But with the threat of a sharp rise in interest rates looming, he says he now feels completely lost.
""I just want a home,"" says the 38-year-old, who fears monthly mortgage repayments will become unaffordable to him just when he wanted to buy his own place.
""I can't find anywhere that I can afford a mortgage on in London or Essex because I don't earn enough,"" he says. ""If I was in a couple it would probably be a different story.""
Mr Price moved out of his rental property to live with his sister in Suffolk while waiting to find somewhere to buy.
""Then Covid hit and I'm still struggling to find somewhere. I'm unsure what to do.""
Friday's mini-budget offered help to first-time buyers by cutting stamp duty, the tax paid when people buy a property in England and Northern Ireland.
But any savings Mr Price could have made from this will be wiped out if interest rates more than double.
Mr Price says he is now looking at houses closer to his father in Norfolk, but fears he will not be able to get a mortgage deal.
Chancellor's plans will require a large increase in government borrowing. 
Concerns among investors about the UK's ability to pay that debt led to the value of the pound falling and pushed the cost of UK government borrowing to near record levels.
Experts said a rise in the cost of long-term borrowing meant the current cost to mortgage lenders of offering new deals was now more expensive. 
re are also concerns that would-be borrowers will rush to secure mortgages at favourable rates before interest rates rise and if they do jump, some homeowners may not be able to afford higher repayments.
A weaker pound makes imports and goods priced in dollars, such as oil, much more costly, and risks fuelling price rises at a time when UK inflation is at its highest for 40 years. 
Some 8.3 million people have mortgages in the UK, according to banking trade body UK Finance.
Bank of England has already lifted interest rates seven times in a row since December to the highest rate in 14 years. 
Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said if interest rates rise as predicted, the average household refinancing a two-year fixed rate mortgage in the first half of next year would see monthly payments jump to £1,490 from £863. 
""Many simply won't be able to afford this,"" he said.
Changes to mortgage deals include: 
Yorkshire Building Society said: ""As a result of the current volatile market conditions, we will be temporarily withdrawing our range of mortgages for new customers at 8pm tonight.
""All applications submitted prior to this will continue as normal."" 
Virgin Money and Skipton Building Society also said applications that have been submitted will proceed. 
Halifax said from Wednesday it would remove mortgage products that come with a fee ""as a result of significant changes in mortgage market pricing we've seen over recent weeks"".
Mortgage deals that have product fees can result in lower monthly repayments for homeowners, with the fee being added to the total mortgage debt. The overall cost of the loan will be higher due to more interest accruing over time.
HSBC UK said that to stay within its operational capacity it needed to limit its range for the rest of the day. 
""Our broker products will be available again on Wednesday 28 September,"" it said. ""We continue to review the situation regularly.""
Post Office said it had temporarily withdrawn all residential and buy-to-let mortgages, adding it will ""be launching new ranges as soon as possible"".
""Customers who have already applied for a mortgage rate with the Post Office will be able to proceed with this rate as normal,"" it said.
Atom bank said its temporary withdrawal of its range of mortgages had ""no impact on anyone who has a valid mortgage offer from us"".
It said it would continue to support existing customers who are looking to vary or move their mortgage and would aim to return to mortgage lending as soon as possible.

entertainment	English National Opera fights 'absurd' plan to relocate to Manchester	"English National Opera's boss has dismissed a plan to move out of London and slash its funding as ""not doable"".
On Friday, Arts Council England said it would axe the company's entire £12.6m annual grant from 2023, instead giving it £17m over three years - but only if it relocates, possibly to Manchester.
On Wednesday, the ENO's Stuart Murphy said: ""I think we're going to be saying to the secretary of state tomorrow and to the Arts Council, 'We can definitely do levelling up, but that can only happen with a big London base.'""
He described the Arts Council's plan - which he only learned about a day before the announcement - as ""absurd"" and ""insane"".
restigious company is now campaigning for the decision to be reversed, and is supporting a petition set up by opera singer Sir Bryn Terfel, which has more than 16,000 signatures.
Mr Murphy said he initially thought a move could be viable. ""We then looked at the money over the weekend,"" he told BBC News.
""We spoke to people that the Arts Council hadn't bothered to speak to in Manchester, from across the opera world, and our staff - and it's just not doable.""
One reason is because opera employs people with specialist skills, both on stage and behind the scenes, he said.
""These are skills that can't just be learned in the three years we've been given. These are people who've been in the company for 40 years. It takes a long time to train to be an opera singer. We can't just close down in one area and start in another.""
Also, opera ""requires fundraising on a pretty big scale"", and Manchester has fewer sources of money - some of which have already been tapped by Opera North, which currently tours to Salford.
""So straight away you've got a situation which is really hard, to pull up the really deep roots of an opera company and just transport it,"" Mr Murphy said.
He claimed the Arts Council had not sounded out Leeds-based Opera North, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, or the new home he said ACE had earmarked for the ENO - Manchester's £210m new arts venue, Factory International.
""This came as a complete surprise to them. It came as a massive surprise to us because our report card from the Arts Council says we're doing an amazing job,"" Mr Murphy said.
""It reminds us that one in seven of our audience are under 35, that a fifth of our singers are ethnically diverse, that our average ticket price is a quarter of that of a normal opera house and we give free tickets to under-21s.
""And we do these amazing things like ENO Breathe with the NHS that happen right across the country. So we've kind of done everything that was asked of us and more, even by the Arts Council's admission.
""So to just put in place a funding suggestion, which is half our funding level, 200 miles away, to happen in 20 weeks, is absurd.""
Mr Murphy, who recently announced his departure as ENO chief executive, called on the Arts Council to carry out a strategic review of opera provision across the country.
He warned: ""If they're not careful, they're going to dismantle an arts organisation that's been in existence for almost 100 years and is seen as a beacon for progressive work that's broken down preconceptions of opera.""
ENO is based at the London Coliseum in the West End and is one of two major opera companies in the capital, along with the Royal Opera.
grant delivered by the Arts Council, using government money, accounts for around a third of its annual income.
mpany took the headlines in a wider redistribution of arts funding after the Arts Council was told by the government to move millions of pounds outside the capital.
Arts Council has said the ENO will not receive any funding after April 2023 if it does not relocate.
A spokesperson said: ""We require English National Opera to relocate the core of their work to another part of England if they wish to continue to receive regular public funding from us.
""We raised Manchester as an option and English National Opera initially received that idea positively. English National Opera's future is in their hands - at this early stage we have announced our funding plans for the next three years, and now we hope to engage in detailed planning with them.
""This would involve English National Opera reshaping their business model and finding a suitable location outside of London.""
ENO's bosses could face the decision of whether to move out of London and keep some public funding, or stay in the capital as a privately-funded operation.
""There definitely could be a private opera house in London. There's lots in the south-east already,"" said Mr Murphy, adding that the ticket prices would inevitably increase.
""Straight away you're talking £300-350 for your most expensive ticket. That is not what brings on new work, brings on talent, brings on the next generation.
""It over-caters to the same rich metropolitan middle class audience, and that's why opera is dying as an artform.""
Manchester's Factory International said it had not been contacted by the ENO, and that the Arts Council had not suggested the ENO would move into its new building. 
A spokeswoman said: ""We would of course be enthusiastic to collaborate with ENO on appropriate projects that fitted both organisations' goals - which in our case would be on new works, not the traditional opera repertoire."""
entertainment	Morecambe and Wise 'Monty Python' UEA interview sparks further find	"Morecambe and Wise call Monty Python 'boring' in a TV interview clip unearthed in 2021
A long-lost Morecambe and Wise interview has been found almost in its entirety after a clip hit the headlines last year - prompting the rediscovery.
medy double act told how they were ""bored stiff"" by Monty Python in an old university TV station interview, in a two-minute clip unearthed in 2021.
A restoration expert spotted the story and remembered having the tape, leading to the longer interview being found.
Film professor Melanie Williams said it was ""so important to preserve"" it.
gendary duo were filmed speaking to the University of East Anglia's (UEA) student TV station Nexus after a performance at Norwich's Theatre Royal in November 1973. 
r bruising take on cult comics Monty Python was revealed, with Eric Morecambe saying the ensemble performed ""university comedy... and I'm afraid that a lot of it is very unprofessional"".
However, this latest find featured most of the seven-minute interview, with just the opening seconds missing. 
Morecambe and Wise appeared in a playful mood, but revealed how they felt ""modern"" performers had it too easy reaching the top.
""I think they've reasonably got it made today,"" said Wise. 
""A lot of people are stars and they shouldn't really be stars. They've been accelerated into it.""
""To start is probably more difficult, but once you're on the way it's easier,"" said Morecambe. 
""There's more money to be earned now. You work clubs nowadays with salaries that the tops of the bills used to be getting when we were youngsters.""
Monty Python clip was discovered last year by former station member Paul Hayes, now a BBC radio producer, when he digitised a duplicate copy he had made from an original VHS compilation tape kept in Nexus' studio.
""When I was a student at the UEA in the early 2000s there was a cupboard full of these old Sony reel-to-reel videotapes from the 1970s in the studio,"" he said. 
""One of them was labelled as having a 'famous Nexus in-depth interview' with Morecambe and Wise on it, but we didn't have anything to play it on.""
In 2004, Mr Hayes sent the tape to the BBC but it was unable to be viewed, so they passed it on to restoration specialist Peter Crocker, who was also unable to salvage any material. 
""Peter hung on to the tape all these years and got in touch with me when the story about their Monty Python criticisms made the news, as it had reminded him that he still had it,"" said Mr Hayes.
Mr Crocker then gave the tape to another specialist David Palfreyman, who runs a specialist film and videotape restoration business, and he managed to play the old format after - bizarrely - baking the tape in his oven.
""After a while tapes tend to get sticky,"" said Mr Palfreyman. 
""Once they get sticky, they start to lose their magnetic strip, and if you start to play it chances are the magnetic strip of the tape is just going to fall off. 
""But if you bake it for a certain length of time it kind of resets everything and dries it out.""
However, the other challenge is trying to find the right machine - which is rarely available second-hand and then it often needs refurbishing before it will work to play obsolete formats. 
Interestingly, the full tape - that ran for almost 40 minutes - also contained an interview with famous French mime artist Marcel Marceau, who appeared at the Norfolk and Norwich Festival in October 1973 but without any of his props after they got lost in transit.
Prof Williams, a lecturer in film and television studies at the UEA, said it was important to preserve such rare material.
""There's stuff that you get from it that you don't see in other kinds of interviews,"" she said.
""It's the perfect justification for why it's important to preserve this kind of material. 
""It is rough around the edges in certain ways, but it enables them to do things that other kinds of media can't do, and I think it's so important to preserve those different perspectives that this kind of media can provide.""
Colin Webb, who was then a 25-year-old mature student at the UEA, carried out the interview and was happy it was now available to view again after nearly half a century.
""It just reminds you what delightful people they were, really,"" he said.
""Totally human and funny and relaxed, and surprisingly very willing to give their time to our university TV.""
Speaking last year, Monty Python member Sir Michael Palin said he was ""a little hurt"", but ""intrigued"" having seen the footage.

entertainment	H&M: Justin Bieber collection axed after singer's 'trash' criticism	"H&M has removed a Justin Bieber-inspired collection after it was branded ""trash"" by the singer.
28-year-old said he had not approved the collection, which included T-shirts, jumpers, tote bags and phone accessories.
Posting on his Instagram Story, the Sorry singer urged people not to buy the items which he said were being sold without his permission or approval.
mpany said proper procedures were followed but have now pulled the line.
""The H&M Merch they made out of me is trash and I didn't approve it,"" Justin wrote on his Instagram story on Tuesday. ""Don't buy it. 
""I didn't approve any of the merch collection that they put up at H&M,"" he continued. 
""All without my permission and approval. I wouldn't buy it if I were you.""
In a statement, H&M defended the fashion line, which reportedly features images of the star.
""As with all other licensed products and partnerships, H&M followed proper approval procedures,"" a spokesperson for the fashion retailer said.
""But out of respect for the collaboration and Justin Bieber we have removed the garments from our stores and online.""
It's not the first time a star has hit out at a brand for using their image without permission.
In 2015, Rihanna won a court case against Topshop - she successfully sued its parent company for £3.3m after it sold a sleeveless T-shirt with her photo on it. 
And in 2019, Ariana Grande brought action against Forever 21 after she claimed it published at least 30 ""unauthorised"" images and videos that suggested she had endorsed the brand.
Justin is currently on a break from touring after he revealed he was suffering from facial paralysis, after a diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome.
Ramsay Hunt syndrome is when a shingles outbreak affects the facial nerve near someone's ears, resulting in paralysis of parts of the face.

entertainment	Hugh Jackman: Wolverine star on mental health problems	"Actor Hugh Jackman has said he was ""a hot mess"" making his latest film, The Son.
54-year-old X-Men star explained: ""I certainly realised how vulnerable I was.""
He plays a successful lawyer with a teenage son (Zen McGrath) from a previous marriage who is suffering from depression. 
Jackman told the BBC the subject matter of the film and returning to acting after not working during Covid lockdowns caused him ""anxiety"". 
And then his father died while he was making the movie.
""My father actually never missed a day of work in his life,"" Jackman says, explaining why he did not take any time off to grieve. ""I did imagine what my father would say and he would say, 'Go to work'."" 
Nonetheless, making The Son was hard and the pressure took its toll.
""I would be one of the least [likely] people I know who I'd describe as a hot mess, but I certainly was during this.""
Jackman suffered sleepless nights while playing the role of Peter, a workaholic with a new partner, young baby, an ex-wife and their troubled teenage son. The star says he continues to consult a therapist who helped him through filming. 
film's producers also employed psychiatrists on set in case members of the cast and crew needed to talk about the upsetting material. 
""This was the first time I'd ever seen such a thing on a film,"" says Jackman, ""and people used it and it was necessary.""
While intimacy coaches have become commonplace when sex scenes are being filmed, Jackman advocates mental health support as well. 
""There's a little part of the old school part of my brain [that thinks], 'Well, that's up to you to work out.' If you need to go to a doctor, for whatever reason, your foot, your mental health, you know, you work that out.
""But I think it certainly would be a sign from an employer that we understand taking care of the whole person, not just paying them, but taking care of their wellbeing in all forms is really, really important."" 
See-Saw films, which produced The Son, worked with the Film and TV Charity, which has developed a free industry-wide resource to destigmatise poor mental health in film and TV.
rity's 2021 Looking Glass survey found that nine in 10 people working in the sector had experienced a mental health problem.
Whole Picture Toolkit offers guidance and advice on supporting mental health and wellbeing on set and pre and post-production and, so far, the kit has been adopted by 35 productions. 
Jackman says he hopes The Son will spark conversations around mental health issues ""that are urgently needed"".  
He says: ""There is a real lack of knowledge and ignorance and shame around the subject and I think it's something we need to confront, really, really quickly.""
film, which explores absentee parenting and the effects of divorce on children as well as adolescent mental illness, is tough to watch. 
While The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw praised the ""beautifully composed and literate drama"", not everyone was a fan of The Son, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival and opens in the UK in February. 
Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney said it was ""a depressing film about depression, while The Times' Kevin Maher dismissed it as ""a wearily predicable slab of family values hokum.""
However, Jackman has already received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor for his role in the drama.
It comes at a moment when some are questioning the future of gendered acting categories in awards ceremonies.
Jackman says he's a ""a big fan"" of having one gender neutral acting category in which all performers compete. 
""That would be a really positive step. I don't understand why it's split into just two genders when we all know it's a much bigger spectrum.""
Acknowledging that he ""might have just shot myself in the foot"" as his own chances of winning would be halved if there was one non-binary acting category instead of separate best actor and actress categories, he adds: ""Whatever the mix is, we should maybe just break down any of those categories that end up being divisive and unnecessary."" 
If the past is anything to go by, Jackman could be in with a shout of taking home an award this season. The Son was co-written and directed by Florian Zeller, who directed the 2020 drama The Father, which earned its star Sir Anthony Hopkins his second Oscar. 
Sir Anthony, famous for his roles in The Silence of the Lambs, the Thor movies and Westworld, makes a cameo appearance in The Son.
And Jackman gives a fascinating insight into how Sir Anthony continues to work after more than six decades on screen. 
""He shot for one day. He spent six months emailing the director Florian every single day. Florian said to me, 'I got as many emails about this one scene in a movie as I did for The Father, where he is in every scene.' He takes it so seriously.""
And that meticulous approach continued on set. 
""At one point, he wanted to redo his close-up again. And I pulled Florian aside and I said: 'But what he did was so incredible.' 
""And he said: 'Oh yeah, I've got everything I need, but I think he just misses acting. He hadn't acted for 18 months. I think he just misses it, he wanted another go.'"" 
Son represents a departure for Jackman, who played Wolverine in nine blockbuster films - and is coming back for at least one more. 
He also made his name in movie musicals, including Les Misérables and The Greatest Showman and on Broadway, where he is currently starring in The Music Man. So how does he pick roles?
""I'm always looking for things that I haven't done before, that challenge me, that scare me,"" Jackman says.
""And by the way, when I did Wolverine, it always scared me, too. That's a million miles away from who I am as well."" "

Valley Rock Voices in Neath is a choir of women aged between 21 and 80.
Founder Cerys Llewellyn-Bevan has created a community for women from all backgrounds and all ages, including mothers to grandmothers.
""We are a huge melting pot of every kind of woman,"" said Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan.
Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan started the choir with 12 friends as what she described as an ""antidote"" to her son Sam's second major operation. 
Now 26, Sam has recovered well.
From the choir, a collective has formed with activities such as walking, swimming, social and fund-raising groups.
""When you become a mum your life becomes all about your children growing up, and I think a lot of women lose the ability to go out and make friends,"" said Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan.
""I needed to get out and find some joy again, and going back to my music-making seemed to be the obvious path as it had brought me much joy previously.""
53-year-old has a classical music background and had stints as head of music at various schools.

""For nine months we didn't meet,"" said Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan. 
""I honestly thought I would never put the choir back together again.
""In November 2020, restrictions started to be eased slightly so I decided to venture out and see if I had anyone who fancied a challenge.""
When restrictions allowed, the choir rehearsed outdoors at Neath RFC, in the rugby stands, socially distanced and groups of 15 at a time.
Bethan Comerford, from Neath, knew Mrs Llewellyn-Bevan from school and found out about the choir on Facebook.
""Up from the sofa I got - my husband said, 'what are you doing?' I said, 'I'm going to join a choir',"" said Ms Comerford.
""It was just what I needed. It's the best thing I have ever done.""
But Ms Comerford's husband died shortly after she joined. 
""It was the middle of Covid, and every night there would be food parcels delivered by people here,"" said the 54-year-old. 
""They were fantastic, and they still are. They're such a great bunch of women.""
Joining the choir has also been of major benefit for its youngest member, Imogen Fish, from Neath. 
Now 21, Ms Fish has done GCSEs, A levels and completed a university degree while with Valley Rock Voices. She is now training to become a teacher.
""When I first started I was so shy,"" she said. 
""I wouldn't speak to anybody or look at anybody. I was going through a tricky time at school. Now I'm a totally different person.""
Joan Powell - the choir's oldest member at 80 - joined on its first day.
""When you get older you don't make lifelong friends so easily, but I have,"" she said. 
""I have formed some beautiful friendships. Everybody takes care of each other. We watch each other's backs."""

Stella Stockbridge, from Aylesbury, began by redesigning an old Jordan trainer before her art went viral on social media.
19-year-old was already using social media for her business until her experiment ""blew up"" online.
""I expected them to get a lot of hate comments... but overwhelmingly people were so supportive,"" she said.
She has produced a seven-part video series showing how she went from cutting out parts of the shoe, to painting it and even adding a light up miniature lamp post.
f was already ruined, she said, and instead of it going to waste, she was inspired to create something out of it.
She said it took a week to redesign the shoe, using unconventional materials like clay, foam board and plaster, to transform it into a piece of art.
Miss Stockbridge said she also gets ideas of what to add and graffiti on the trainers from her social media followers, and dubbed the style ""sneaker sculpture"".
""The final sneaker has a little part of everyone who supported me on it and it makes it all the more special to me,"" she said. 
Her videos attract thousands of views, however one garnered more than a million, with commenters debating whether her work should be classed as graffiti or vandalism.
She said: ""I expected them to get loads of hate comments because people get quite territorial over shoes... but overwhelmingly people were so supportive.""
She said negative comments created a conversation over what qualifies as art. 
Miss Stockbridge also discovered a whole new community of supporters on TikTok, and said it felt like people ""have her back"".
Ms Stockbridge has been heavily influenced by graffiti and street art and has found that art has helped her with her own identity. 
She said: ""Graffiti as an art form is so self-expressive and you can turn the most blank wall into something so beautiful.
""When I was younger I was quite nervous and I didn't have the best sense of identity so I feel like art has really helped me with that,"" she said.

musician revealed the diagnosis in a letter read by his former bandmates as they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Saturday.
was meant to be as a reunion for the band, whose classic line-up has not played together since 2006.
r said he was ""massively disappointed"" to miss the show, and had ""bought a new guitar"" for the occasion.
Singer Simon Le Bon read Taylor's letter to the audience, which read: ""Just over four years ago I was diagnosed with stage four metastatic prostate cancer. 
""Many families have experienced the slow burn of this disease and of course we are no different; so I speak from the perspective of a family man but with profound humility to the band, the greatest fans a group could have and this exceptional accolade.""
r, who was born in Tynemouth, wrote that he was receiving ""sophisticated life-extending treatment"", but had recently suffered a ""setback,"" that prevented him travelling to Los Angeles for the ceremony.
""Although my current condition is not immediately life-threatening there is no cure,"" he added.
Formed in Birmingham, Duran Duran were one of the biggest pop bands of the 1980s, known for their lavish videos and danceable, synthesized pop singles.
were first band to be inducted at this year's Hall of Fame concert, and opened the show with a hit-packed medley that included Girls On Film, Hungry Like The Wolf and Ordinary World.
Dolly Parton, Eminem, Lionel Richie, Eurythmics, Pat Benatar, Eminem, Carly Simon, Harry Belafonte and Judas Priest were also added to the Hall of Fame roster.
Parton, whose hits include Jolene, I Will Always Love You and 9 To 5, initially rejected her nomination, saying she didn't think country music was eligible, but later relented.
""I'm a rock star now!"" she said during her acceptance speech. 
""Back when they said they were going to induct me into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I didn't really think that I'd done enough to deserve that. I didn't understand at the time. But this is a very, very special night for me.""
Afterwards, the singer performed a star-studded version of Jolene, joined by Pat Benatar, Eurythmics' singer Annie Lennox, Simon Le Bon, Brandi Carlile, and Judas Priest's Rob Halford.
Eminem was inducted by Dr Dre, who said almost everyone he knew had tried to discourage him from working with a white rapper.
But ""I knew that his gifts were undeniable,"" Dre said. ""Each of us was what the other one needed - and I was willing to bet my entire career on it.""
Eminem, real name Marshall Mathers, used his speech to namecheck the rappers who had influenced him, from pioneers Tupac, Chuck D, Outkast and Snoop Dogg to more underground names like Lord Finesse and JJ Fad.
He did so partly to highlight the Hall of Fame's lack of recognition for hip-hop (he is only the ninth rap act to be inducted alongside Run DMC, NWA, Jay-Z, LL Cool J, Biggie Smalls, Tupac Shakur, Public Enemy, Beastie Boys and Grandmaster Flash).
""Those were my rock stars, man,"" said the musician. ""And I just want to say, those are just a few of the names that I hope will be considered in the future for induction. Because without them, a lot of us wouldn't be here. I know I wouldn't.""
Eminem went on to perform his hits My Name Is, Rap God and Sing for the Moment - the latter accompanied by Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, who was sampled on the original song.
He then brought out Ed Sheeran for a live rendition of Stan.
""I'm not supposed to be here tonight,"" said Eminem following his set. ""One, I'm a rapper; two, I almost died from an overdose; and three, I really had to fight my way through… I'm a high school drop-out with a hip-hop education.""

""I feel like we broke through the music industry together,"" said Jackson ""They taught me so much, and I learned their lessons well.
""When I went to work on what became Control in their hometown of Minneapolis, there was pressure. We felt like we were kids in a sandbox… We talked and laughed so much that sometimes it didn't even feel like we were making a record.""
British metal band Judas Priest took the stage with estranged guitarist KK Downing, who in 2011, playing classics like You've Got Another Thing Comin', Breaking The Law and Living After Midnight.
""I'm the gay guy in the band,"" said frontman Rob Halford. 
""We call ourselves the heavy metal community, which is all-inclusive, no matter what your sexual identity is, what you look like, or what you believe in or don't believe in. Everybody's welcome.""
Eurythmics were inducted by U2's the Edge, Lionel Richie by Lenny Kravitz, and Carly Simon by Sara Bareilles.
Simon, whose two younger sisters both died in recent weeks, declined to perform, but Barailles took her place, singing Nobody Does It Better, followed by Olivia Rodrigo who delivered a strutting version of You're So Vain.

Jack, 35, said the book was inspired by both his own childhood memories of visiting the 130-year-old statues and the questions of his curious four-year-old twins.
""It was always really special and really big and exciting to go to Cardiff,"" said Jack, who grew up in nearby Caerphilly and now lives a few miles away in Pontypridd.  
""The animals on the wall always took my interest, there was always this eeriness about them - it's just such a strange collection of animals.""
He found himself wondering if the animals could be more than mere statues. 
""I had ideas when I was younger about them coming to life, I had a really active imagination,"" he said. 
""It was kind of a nice place for your mind to wander off to, thinking about those animals wandering around and kind of what they would do.""
During the Covid pandemic lockdowns he began illustrating the stone animals.
""The idea was nature was thriving in our absence without cars and what-have-you and were able to explore new territory,"" he said.  
He also spent time during lockdowns out exploring with his children. 
""It was looking at them and the way that they see things and imagine that pushed me again to [write the book],"" he said.
k will be released on 29 October, and a city-wide animal art trail based on his story is planned for the October half-term.
Funded by the City Ambition Fund, the free event will see families invited to go on an adventure across Cardiff to find the animals who have escaped from the pages of Jack's tale.
Jack will also be hosting a series of children's book readings. 
He said he had enjoyed showing his own children the landmarks depicted in his book.
""They're really excited for it, there's that experience of taking them to these places and they're actually real, watching their minds and seeing the questions they have afterwards has been really, really fun,"" he said. 
Cardiff Castle's animal wall has been delighting adults and children alike since it was installed in 1890.
mas Nicholls began carving the animals in the late 1880s, based on sketches by architect William Burges, who was employed by the 3rd Marquess of Bute.
re were originally eight animals on the wall - a pair of lions holding shields, a lioness, a polar bear, a sea lion, a wolf, an ape and a hyena, and it was situated directly in front of the castle.
In the 1920s the wall was moved to its present position west of the castle after road widening on Castle Street, and a further seven animals by sculptor Alexander Carrick were added  - the lynx, vulture, beaver, leopard, raccoon, pelican and anteater. The polar bear was also replaced by a bear.
Night of the Animal Wall art and sculpture trail will run in Cardiff from 29 October until 4 November as part of FOR Cardiff's City of Arcades week. "

entertainment	Liverpool's Eurovision arena investigates safety concerns at Jamie Webster gig	"Liverpool arena where the Eurovision Song Contest will be held next year has apologised and pledged to investigate after fans complained about safety concerns at a sold-out concert.
Some fans at the M&S Bank Arena to see Jamie Webster on Saturday reported overcrowding and poor ticket checks.
Paul Lang, from Birkenhead, said: ""It didn't feel like a safe environment.""
ue said there were reports of overcrowding but it was resolved, and appropriate ticket checks were done.
Police said they ""did attend the venue briefly"". Indie singer-songwriter Webster, who was playing his biggest home town gig, had to cut the encore from his set.
Mr Lang told BBC Radio Merseyside his tickets weren't checked, and the entrance tunnel was ""completely full"".
""The group around us when we were getting let in, I would say at least 15-20 people walked away and were just not dealing with it, and more people were coming out, getting a bit worked up, panicked about it, and just said, 'It's just not worth it for our own safety.'""
Staff were ""just standing around"" and ""didn't seem to really show any interest"", he said.
""It felt like, if we did become in a situation that we really didn't want to be in and we were in that tunnel, I don't feel like the staff would have done anything at all really.""
Another fan, Liam Kelly, also from the Wirral, said there were long queues outside the venue.
""By the time we got close to the door, the head steward told us that we weren't going to get in because it was overcrowded,"" he told Radio Merseyside. ""They were her words.
""There were people who were coming out of the gig in tears, a lot of people looking very stressed, and shouting for people to not go in. Quite a few people in the queue at that point turned around and left.""
After the head steward got into an argument, ""she kind of left and then there was this chaos at the door where everyone just started to walk in"", Mr Kelly added.
""I presented my phone to be scanned and I had all the tickets for my group on there. So the first ticket they came to was one that had already been used by somebody else. It scanned red, and the person who's got my ticket [to check it] did not care. He's just waved me in, and that was the moment that I looked around, and nobody was having their tickets checked.""
xperience of getting in was ""really horrible"", he said. ""It was the entrance way and the bar area that were absolute chaos. You couldn't move. It took ages to get through.""
Once fully inside, it was the busiest he had ever seen the arena, ""but the venue itself inside didn't feel unsafe"", he added.
In a statement, Faye Dyer, managing director of ACC Liverpool Group, which runs the arena, said: ""There were reports of overcrowding at one of the floor bars, however the crowd congestion was resolved and people were dispersed.
""Merseyside Police received a report of concern for safety at the venue just before 9.30pm and attended the venue for a short period whilst our events security dealt with the incident. The event was deemed safe to continue.
""The process for checking tickets is a rigorous one and we understand all appropriate checks were made on the night. The safety of our customers is of the utmost importance; we take any incident seriously and a detailed investigation has already begun.
""We sincerely apologise to both the artist Jamie, who was playing the biggest show of his life, and to his fans for any aspects of their experience which fell short of their expectations. We wish to thank Jamie and his promoter for their support in removing the encore to ensure the remainder of the show continued to operate safely.""
A spokesperson added: ""As safety is our number one priority and as operators of the venue, we agreed with the artist's promoter that Jamie would not perform an encore. This was not a police request.""
On Tuesday, the venue gave more details in a set of FAQs, which said its investigation would ""help us understand the issues from this event and ensure we learn from it"". 
11,000-capacity arena was named the Eurovision host venue last month, and can expect sold-out crowds when it hosts the grand final plus two semi-finals next May."
entertainment	Stormzy says the 'token black artist' trope needs to die	"Stormzy has said he has made a conscious decision to promote his black peers and predecessors, to combat prejudice in the music industry.
""I've always understood I'm the black act. Maybe the token black act,"" the superstar British rapper told DJ Trevor Nelson in a one-off BBC special.
""I want to kill that where it stands.""
's why, the star explained, he paused his historic Glastonbury Festival set to read a list of 52 rappers who influenced him.
It also prompted him to populate the video for his recent single, Mel Made Me Do It, with musicians Little Simz, Dave and Gabrielle; sports legends Usain Bolt, Ian Wright and Dina Asher-Smith; and the author Malorie Blackman.
""There's always been this stigma of, 'let one through',"" he said. ""There's one black [man], one black woman at a time. That needs to die. 
""So that's why when I get Glasto, when I do Mel Made Me Do It, it's like, 'This is us... We stand on your shoulders.' 
""I didn't just pop out of the blue and break the matrix.""
Stormzy is also supporting new generations of black talent through his Merky foundation, which offers scholarships to Cambridge University; and Merky FC, which aims to improve diversity among football managers, coaches and other behind-the-scenes roles.
45-minute BBC special saw Stormzy perform a mix of classic hits and new songs, and sit down for a candid interview with Nelson about his origins, his rise to fame and why headlining Glastonbury had calmed his inner demons.
""It gave me such a peace in terms of knowing, all right, if it all falls [apart], you've done it. Now you can walk with your head high.""
musician said the performance had given him the confidence to pursue a more soulful, spiritual direction on his new album This Is What I Mean.
He cited Stevie Wonder, Frank Ocean and Lauryn Hill among the record's influences - but reserved his highest praise for Whitney Houston, who he named the ""greatest of all time"".
""I've got a lot of GOATs, but Whitney is my GOAT GOAT,"" he said.
""If I leave here and I get in my car and I listen to Whitney, I'm thinking, you've done something that's intangible.
""You haven't put your hand on my back, you haven't shaken my hand, you haven't given me a hug - but you have just hit me in my soul.""
Stormzy also talked about his long-standing friendship with fellow Londoner Adele. 
""I'm a genuine fan,"" he told Nelson. ""She's blessed with a gift of a stunning, beautiful, moving voice and a phenomenal pen. And her ability to marry what she's gone through, her experiences, her feelings, with art and melody, is second to none.""
However, he said he had never considered asking her to appear on one of his records.
""Our friendship ain't based off [that]. That's never the conversation. 
""Anyone who does music that is my real-life friend... Adele, Ed [Sheeran], Dave, Chris Martin, it's never off that basis. I'll be fine to never make music with any of them. 
""However, if I could get a hook...!"" he joked, before adding: ""But no, I never, I never."""
entertainment	Terry Hall: Tributes to The Specials singer who was 'one of the greats'	"music world has been paying tribute to singer Terry Hall, remembering The Specials frontman as ""truly one of the greats"" who had ""a heart of gold"".
Hits like Ghost Town, Gangsters and Too Much Too Young soundtracked British life in the late 1970s and early 80s.
ributes came from UB40, Boy George and Elvis Costello, who said his voice ""was the perfect instrument for the true and necessary songs on The Specials"".
He added: ""That honesty is heard in so many of his songs in joy and sorrow.""
Costello produced The Specials' self-titled 1979 debut album.
rheaded the Two Tone and ska scenes, and were groundbreaking for their multi-racial membership and how they used pop music to reflect an era of upheaval, unemployment and racial tension.
Billy Bragg recalled: ""The Specials were a celebration of how British culture was invigorated by Caribbean immigration but the onstage demeanour of their lead singer was a reminder that they were in the serious business of challenging our perception of who we were in the late 1970s.""
Hall's friend and biographer Paul Willo told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the singer ""was the instantly recognisable voice of a generation"".
""And he was a forthright character who stood up for what he believed in. Together with the band, he was very vocal about racism and injustice in general,"" he added.
""There was so much turmoil going on in the country at that time… With the right material and the reasons to be angry, it made them more of a force and him more vocal, I suppose.""
Singer Frank Turner was born shortly after The Specials split up in 1981 but told Today their music remained relevant.
""It was talking about the fact that there are these tensions in society, there are these things that are worth being angry about, there are these divides, and there are things that we can do about them,"" Turner said.
""That was important and relevant in the early 1980s but for me as a kid, it felt important and relevant and - I don't want to say educational - when I first started listening to them.
""And I think the relevance of the music of The Specials and the words and music of Terry Hall remain completely vibrant and important today.""
raising Hall and his influence ranged from singer-songwriters to pop stars and dance acts.
Electronic duo Leftfield wrote on Twitter that Hall was ""such an amazing singer"", adding: ""He sang about real people and real issues. People I could identify with. Such a loss. A brave guy.""
Former Bros singer Matt Goss said The Specials were very important because they ""made you feel alive"" and Ghost Town was ""a masterpiece"".
""The Specials represent my youth, they represent everything about my teenage years, they were THE BAND that got us out of our homes and into the school discos & clubs!"" he wrote.
""And [they] turned us on to a trend that was an all encompassing movement of music and fashion SKA!!... The Specials gave you a sense of strength, while still allowing the sensitive side of artistry to run through your veins.""
Andy Bell of the bands Ride and Oasis also recalled the impact of The Specials' songs and look.
""At 11 I suddenly wanted a Harrington [jacket] with red tartan lining, a Fred Perry shirt, black sta prest [trousers], white socks and black loafers with tassels, all because this man's music had swept through my school like Elvis in '56,"" Bell said.
""Those 2 @the specials albums are pure genius.""
Former The Cure drummer Lol Tolhurst described seeing Hall live at two concerts - one in 1979 and another in 2022. 
""Both times Terry Hall standing stock still at the centre of the storm, a melancholy counter point to the joyous energy of the band. Bringing the idiosyncratic and ironic songs to life beautifully.""
Squeeze's Chris Difford described Hall as ""a man of few words verbally but so many great words in song"", adding: ""I always admired and envied his sweep of the pen. Take care on the steps above young man.""
Listen to more about Terry Hall on BBC Sounds
Carole Donnelly, a friend of Hall's, told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""He was kind, witty, but a very shy man. He was somebody who was so talented.
""For me he inspired you to overcome adversity and hatred... turn your back on hate and turn that into love. That was the thing that it was.
""He was a legend, and he's a legend in Coventry. It was a horrible time to be in the city but they gave us hope. I was in a mixed race relationship, the political landscape and music and lyrics gave us a voice as young people. I was 16 when I met him, he was 18, we were angry young punks. We got to love music and we brought that all together and it's inspired so many generations of people.""
Happy Mondays singer Rowetta told the station: ""He just believed in everything and really with passion. He wouldn't be singing lyrics he didn't mean with no feeling. He wrote lyrics that meant something.  
""He really cared about people as well, his politics weren't just for the sake of it, he really meant it and wanted to help the world. He really did believe in that. Love, love, love.""
Specials came from Coventry, and Dave Wakeling of ska band The Beat - from nearby Birmingham - posted a photo of the pair playing football with the message: ""Cryptic, droll, a heart of gold, and he could tackle like a donkey!
""Always a proper gent to The Beat, our condolences to family and friends.""
Proclaimers described him as ""a quite brilliant, singer, songwriter and lyricist with profound humanity"".
UB40, also from Birmingham, wrote: ""Another one gone too soon! RIP Terry.""
Dexy's Midnight Runners said they were ""very sorry and shocked to hear the sad news about the lovely, and brilliant Terry Hall"".
Other bands paying tribute included The Coral, who said: ""Thanks Terry Hall for all the music, inspiration, and being kind to us when we were starting out. So sad."" 
Specials' influence stretched across the Atlantic, with Canadian singer Ron Sexsmith remembering how he had ""been a fan of their music ever since seeing them perform Gangsters on SNL [Saturday Night Live] when I was 16"".
He added: ""It was a pretty exciting period for music and they were definitely a huge part of it."""

entertainment	James Corden and Ricky Gervais: Can you steal a joke?	"James Corden has admitted ""inadvertently"" using material by fellow comedian Ricky Gervais as part of a routine on The Late Late Show.
During a monologue about Elon Musk's Twitter takeover he made a joke strikingly similar to one Gervais made in 2018 on his show Humanity.
It was delivered, he said, ""obviously not knowing it came from him"".
Gervais later deleted a response in which he said one of Corden's writers probably ""came up with it"" for him.
While there has been the usual reaction of comments and memes on social media, one question you might be wondering is can you - legally - take someone else's joke?
Laura Trapnell from Paris Smith solicitors has told BBC Newsbeat that a joke could be protected either as a literary work, if the comedian wrote it down, or a dramatic work if it was performed.
jokes also have to be substantially alike - so what was said?
""When you see Elon Musk talk about Twitter he does this thing where he goes, 'Well, it's the town square',"" ran Corden's joke.
""But it isn't. Because if someone puts up a poster in a town square that says 'Guitar lessons available' you don't get people in the town go, 'I don't want to play the guitar'. Well that sign wasn't for you it was for somebody else, you don't have to get mad about all of it.""
Now let's compare it with the Ricky Gervais version.
""That's like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard and there's a notice - 'guitar lessons' - and you go 'but I don't want guitar lessons' - fine, it's not for you then, just walk away, don't worry about it."" 
But after being called out online, Corden said he told the joke ""obviously not knowing it came from [Gervais]"".
uld be an important distinction, according to Laura.
""The infringer is the person who affects the copying, so that may not be James Corden if, as Ricky Gervais suggests, his team wrote the joke and he merely delivered it,"" she says.
""If he had no idea that the joke was copied, then James Corden would be what's called an innocent infringer.
""This means that he's still liable for performing a copied dramatic work. It all starts to get a bit complicated. 
""The writers would be the ones in the firing line,"" Laura says.
Faizan Shah, 28, is a comedian who performs stand-up sets around Manchester, and he believes that the joke came from the Late Late Show's writers.
But he says writers often have ""added pressure"" to produce jokes quickly, which may sometimes lead to duplication.
""Sometimes you can't exactly think of something original, which is going to be unbelievably funny right off the bat,"" he says. 
""So writers end up drawing off the back of something else that you already know is funny and your work.""
In terms of whether joke stealing is ever OK, Fazian has a strong opinion: that you should never pass off another comic's work as your own. 
""It's just a massive no, no - because you're basically just trying to steal an idea,"" he says. 
""Ricky Gervais has written it, and probably performed it multiple times to work out how he wants to perform it, to then just 'I'll just have that' you're basically not showing respect to the art form,"" he adds.

entertainment	Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas is You copyright case dropped	"Singer Mariah Carey is no longer being sued for copyright infringement over her hit song All I Want for Christmas is You, after country singer Andy Stone dropped his legal action.
Songwriter Mr Stone sued the popstar in June, claiming he co-wrote a song with the same name five years earlier.
He told the court he would dismiss the case - but legally he could refile it.
A must-have on any festive playlist, Carey's mega-hit is one of the best known Christmas records of all time.
Mr Stone, who performs under the name Vince Vance with the band Vince Vance and the Valiants, previously filed the lawsuit in a New Orleans federal court - where he also filed to have the case dismissed.
He was claiming at least $20m (£16m) in damages, arguing that Carey exploited his ""popularity"" and ""style"".
Despite sharing a title, the two songs are musically different, but Mr Stone claimed that Carey did not ask for permission to use the song name and had earned ""undeserved profits"" from it. 
It is not unusual for different songs to have the same name, and the United States Copyright Office lists 177 entries on its website under the title All I Want for Christmas is You.
Since appearing on the album Merry Christmas in 1994, the song has topped the charts in several countries and by 2017 had reportedly earned Carey more than $60m (£48m) in royalties.
It has been streamed over one billion times on Spotify.
In a recent memoir, Carey admitted to composing ""most of the song on a cheap little Casio keyboard"".

health	Glan Clwyd: Serious failings led to death of man - inquest	"A man died from bronchial pneumonia in hospital after information regarding his care was not transferred correctly, a coroner's court has heard.
A hearing into the death of David Schofield Diamond found ""serious failings"" at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire.
79-year-old was admitted with pneumonia and sepsis two weeks before his death in November 2021.
Betsi Cadwaladr health board told the inquest plans to improve had been made.
Mr Diamond, from Prestatyn, had also tested positive for Covid-19 and was having difficulties eating and drinking. 
He was initially placed in the high dependency area of the Covid ward and his breathing was assisted, the hearing was told.
He was also assessed by the speech and language team, who recommended a soft diet of mildly thickened fluids. 
After about 10 days, his condition began to improve and healthcare staff discussed a discharge plan with him and his daughter. 
But when he was moved into another area on the same ward, the information regarding his fluids and diet was not transferred with him to the whiteboard above his new bed. 
ree days before his death, a physiotherapist noticed unthickened drinks on his bedside table, some of which had been consumed. 
On 11 November, Mr Diamond's condition deteriorated to a point where an assessment should have been made by the on-call doctor, with two-hourly observations then taken, and the nurse-in-charge informed. 
However, no observations were made for seven hours and the nurse-in-charge was not told. 
His condition continued to deteriorate and he became unresponsive. A chest X-ray showed there had been aspiration, and he was placed on intravenous antibiotics, but Mr Diamond died on 13 November. 
In a statement read to the coroner's court in Ruthin, the bank nurse looking after Mr Diamond overnight, Gwenda Long, said she had assumed the healthcare support team would do Mr Diamond's two-hourly observations. 
She said she did not escalate his condition to the nurse-in-charge or the assessment team because she had ""misread the term ward-based care"" in his notes, and thought medical escalation was not necessary. 
Giving a narrative conclusion, David Lewis, assistant coroner for north Wales, east and central, said the case showed a ""lack of recognition of deteriorating patient"" with ""human and communication errors"" involved. 
Mr Lewis said that though Mr Diamond had died from pneumonia, a natural cause, the aspiration that played a part was not natural, and it was ""likely"" he aspirated due to consumption of unthickened fluid in the hospital, in spite of recommendations. 
Mr Lewis added that though he could not be satisfied that it would have made a difference to Mr Diamond had a doctor been called at an earlier stage when his condition deteriorated, there had been ""serious failings"" in his care.  
Jane Woollard, associate director of nursing for the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board told the inquest that an improvement plan had been put in place following an investigation into Mr Diamond's death, which included the introduction of colour-coded information sheets on dietary requirements which move around the hospital with patients and a plan to train all nurses to carry out swallow assessments. 
Mr Diamond's daughter, Jody Diamond said she felt let down and was ""heartbroken"" by the loss of her father. "
health	Diphtheria: Migrants with symptoms to be isolated	"Migrants with symptoms of diphtheria are to be put into isolation, as cases of the disease rise, ministers say.
wing signs of infection will be separated for a ""short period"" at the Manston processing centre in Kent, or at a ""designated isolation centre"" while they are treated.
follows the death of a man at Manston, which may have been caused by diphtheria. 
Health secretary Steve Barclay said the risk to the public was ""very low"". 
During a visit to the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, Mr Barclay said a ""very high uptake"" of diphtheria vaccinations within the British public meant many people were well protected. 
He stressed that the situation was being monitored ""closely"".
Diphtheria is a highly contagious infection that affects the nose, throat and sometimes cause ulcers on the skin.
According to the NHS website, it is spread by coughs and sneezes or through close contact with someone who is infected, and in serious cases can be fatal.
It can also be spread by sharing items such as cups, cutlery, clothing or bedding with an infected person. 
UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said there had been an ""increase"" in cases of diphtheria reported among migrants arriving in the UK.
It has confirmed 50 cases were identified as of 25 November, including among children. The figure stood at 39 on November 10.
Public health experts have raised concerns about the spread of the disease as migrants were moved to hotels.
UKHSA report said 38 of the cases have been reported in south-east England, with some cases also detected across London, the West Midlands and the north-east of England.
re offered to people on arrival at their new accommodation.
Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said any asylum seekers who may have the infection but are already in hotels will be told to isolate in their rooms while they are treated. 
He later confirmed the isolation centres would be similar to those used to curb infections during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Mr Jenrick told the Commons: ""From today, no-one presenting with symptoms will progress into the asylum accommodation system.
""They will either remain at Manston, isolating for a short period, or they will travel to a designated isolation centre in secure transport where they will be treated until deemed medically fit.""
reatment of migrants at the processing centre in Kent has triggered a wave of campaigns and concern from health professionals and campaigners. 
At one point, the facility designed to hold 1,600 people contained 4,000. 
Charity Detention Action launched a legal campaign to remove migrants housed in the facility for longer than 24 hours.  
Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the overcrowding was caused by a lack of suitable accommodation.
She told MPs: ""What I have refused to do is to prematurely release thousands of people into local communities without having anywhere for them to stay.""
A post-mortem examination is being carried out to determine the cause of death of the man who died after being held at Manston.  A test indicated ""diphtheria may be the cause"" of his illness, government officials have said."
health	East Midlands Ambulance Service workers begin strike action over pay	"East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) workers have begun strike action as part of a national pay dispute with the government.
24-hour action from ambulance staff across most of England and Wales on Wednesday is expected to affect non life-threatening calls only.
In the East Midlands, the action by the GMB union - which started at 06:00 GMT - will involve up to 50% of staff.
EMAS said it would aim to minimise the impact of strike action on patients.
means patients who have non life-threatening conditions will have to wait longer for an ambulance.
NHS said ""where safe and appropriate"", those people might be asked to make their own way to hospital, but should seek advice from 111 or 999 before doing so. 
rike will end at 06:00 on Thursday, and is set to continue from 06:00 on 28 December, to 06:00 on 29 December.
Ferdousara Uddin, regional organiser from GMB, said: ""It's not just about pay. It's about understaffing and the cuts being made that put patients at risk.
""The ambulance services are running at deeply unsafe levels and under extreme pressure every day.
""We need action from the government and proper investment into the service.""
Ms Uddin added: ""You can see and hear for yourself - it's been fantastic. We've had people stopping to speak to the ambulance workers to show their support.
""They've dropped off food, or just to have a chat"". 
Melissa Farrell, 36, a paramedic on the picket line in Lincoln, said: ""On Friday night I was on the back of an ambulance outside Lincoln A&E for seven hours followed by nine-and-a-half hours on Saturday night.
""It's about better working conditions for staff and for the public.
""We want to help the public and at the moment our hands are tied while we're stuck outside A&E. We're unable to get to those who truly need us. 
""We are here in the event of a real emergency, but at the moment we're overloaded with going to things which could be helped by other means.""
Her colleague Ellie Flinton, 30, said: ""There's a national shortage of nurses, paramedics, healthcare workers and we want the pay to be attractive so that people want to come into this job.
""We want our pay to be representative of what we do so people want to stay as well.
""In my opinion there are lives being put at risk every single day because of the way the service is currently running.""
One paramedic based in Nottinghamshire told PA News that patients' lives had been at risk ""longer than these strikes were even considered"".
m, 33, who did not want to provide his last name, said: ""I've attended elderly patients who have been on the floor with broken hips for over 20 hours.
""They've been waiting that long that their limbs have started to become necrotic (dying tissue), resulting in major surgery to remove said limbs.""
""In 14 hours I saw and attended one patient of my own and did not have a break... And there were, at one point, 11 ambulances stuck at (the) hospital unable to be freed back onto the road.
""The conditions we work in on a regular basis don't enable us to do the job we want to do to its full capacity and is putting patients' lives at risk long before strikes were even considered.
""We regularly go 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 hours without a break or even so much as a brew or any warm food, or food at all, due to these delays.""
""The ambulance service striking is one that has very little bearing on the grand scheme of things but hopefully has a big influence on highlighting the already failing NHS we so desperately need to treasure and invest in."" 
By Rob Sissons, BBC East Midlands Today health correspondent 
Another day, another strike. On Wednesday, it is the turn of ambulance workers and at England's second biggest ambulance trust.
re is a degree of apprehension about how the day will pan out. It is the GMB union that is striking with hundreds of members across many grades of staff from ambulance paramedics to call handlers. The ambulance service has always been about managing risk triaging 999 calls - those risks increase dramatically when a swathe of staff are missing on strike. 
GMB union says relations with the trust are good and they will liaise across the day. If there is a life-threatening emergency and no nearby ambulances, some strikers could be asked to come back to work. 
All disputes eventually come to an end but in the case of NHS workers, it feels like we in so many ways are stuck at the beginning. The government insists the pay claims are unaffordable in the current economic context. 
All sides are fighting for the hearts and minds of the public.
government has said it stands by a pay offer recommended by the independent pay review body and has criticised how the strike has been organised.
East Midlands Ambulance Service is made up of more than 4,000 workers represented by the GMB, Unison and Unite unions.
Unison has 1,296 staff at EMAS - made up of the likes of paramedics, technicians, call centre staff and mechanics.
Its members are not striking as the BBC understands they were 40 votes short of meeting the 50% threshold for action. 
New ballot papers for its members will be issued in the new year.
Ben Holdaway, director of operations at EMAS, said: ""During the period of the dispute, we will do all we can to minimise the impact on patient safety and will continue to work very closely with trade union colleagues, regional service providers and NHS employers.
""Patients should continue to call for an ambulance as normal if they experience a life-threatening emergency and should continue to access other more appropriate services for any other illnesses or injuries.
""We fully respect the right of NHS staff to take lawful and peaceful industrial action, however we do urge national employer representatives and trade union colleagues to proactively engage and reach a negotiated settlement to the dispute as quickly as possible.""
mes as a ""critical incident"" was declared across Nottinghamshire, due to high demand for hospital services. 
Operations have been cancelled, with nurses across the country also walking out on Tuesday.

health	Bristol team developing 'smart' menstrual cup and app	"A ""smart"" menstrual cup is being developed that aims to help empower women to get appropriate medical treatment and diagnosis.   
'Emm' cup is being developed by a Bristol team and is a reusable cup made from medical-grade silicone.
Currently in the second phase of testing, it is set to be launched in 2023.
GP and menopause expert Dr Julia Balfour said the Emm cup could reduce the need for invasive medical testing.
roduct aims to track the flow, volume, rate and regularity of menstruation and has sensors that connect with a smart phone app.
It has been designed to allow the user to track irregularities or changes in their cycle that could indicate a health issue, and its developers say it can also tell the user when the cup needs emptying.
Dr Balfour said certain female health conditions currently require invasive testing procedures and it would be ""lovely to imagine a world where this is being done effortlessly by a menstrual cup"".
CEO and founder Jenny Button said she had seen an opportunity to create a product that allowed women to ""non-invasively"" track their reproductive health.
""I wanted better health outcomes for women with the gender health gap,"" she said.
She said menstrual blood was rich in ""biomarkers"", which can provide information about health.
However, she said many woman were unable to identify reproductive symptoms due to not having access to their own menstrual health data.
One of the most common reasons women visit their doctor is due to heavy bleeding, says Ms Button, adding that one in five women suffer from menorrhagia - a condition that causes heavy menstrual bleeding.
""No one has the information on their menstrual volume at present, so diagnosis requires invasive tests or individual subjective recall of product usage."" 
Ms Button also hopes to encourage more women to transition to menstrual cups, reducing the number of period products that go to landfill each year.

health	South Western Ambulance Service declares critical incident	"South Western Ambulance Service has declared a critical incident after having 700 calls waiting to be dispatched on Tuesday.
rvice will take various measures, such as cancelling staff training, to address demand, according to BBC West health correspondent Matthew Hill. 
It comes on the eve of the first ambulance strike in over 30 years ago set for Wednesday, 21 December.
usands of staff are taking action in a dispute over pay and staffing levels.
BBC understands even at the busiest times pre-pandemic the service would be used to half the number of calls it received on Tuesday.
People have already been urged to only call 999 in life-threatening emergencies ahead of the strike action. 
Staff will leave the picket line for emergencies, union Unison said.
A government minister said if people need an ambulance they ""should most definitely seek that in the usual way"". 
m Pursglove, a minister for disabled people, health and work, said it was ""absolutely essential"" that ministers continue to engage with the unions. 
""But also that the NHS works tirelessly in local areas to make sure that the right cover is in place,"" he added.
government has said that about 1,200 members of the military and 1,000 civil servants will be drafted in to cover for striking ambulance and Border Force staff over Christmas.
Speaking ahead of Wednesday's strike action, Will Warrender, chief executive at the service, said they were ""sorry"" for any delays in response times.
""The public can help us by only calling 999 for life-threatening emergencies, we absolutely must have crews available for the most life-threatening conditions and we will be prioritising these patients,"" he added.
He asked people not to call back asking for an estimated time of arrival of an ambulance and said that if a patient's condition is not life-threatening they may be directed to alternative services.
Mr Warrender spoke as the service said there were 420 patients waiting for ambulances across the area on Monday, with 152 ambulances outside hospitals waiting to handover patients.
Kevin Stephens, from Gloucestershire, waited for more than 15 hours with his mother for an ambulance after her GP said she might have deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and needed to go to hospital. 
Speaking to BBC West, he said: ""She is housebound so we couldn't drive her there or take a taxi. 
""When we got there they found she had a blood and urine infection - she wasn't able to have a scan for the DVT because the equipment wasn't working.""
She later spent the a night on a reclining chair because there was not a bed available before she was transferred to a ward, he said.
Mr Stephens said he had ""mixed emotions"" about the strike because he is ""very worried"" about his mother but is also ""very angry about the state the health care system is in"". 
""I don't blame the NHS workers for this,"" he said.
""Thousands of people up and down the country are really suffering. Our NHS is broken and it needs to be fixed.""
As well as planned strike action, cold weather and busy hospitals are putting increasing pressure on the service, the ambulance service said.
Chris Hewett, from Unison, said there were ambulance stations are spread out across the South West and ""we're confident that our Unison members who are on the picket line will want to respond to any emergencies in their local communities"".

health	Fresh talks to avert strike by NHS Scotland staff	"re will be fresh talks on Tuesday to try to avert a strike by NHS staff in Scotland, BBC Scotland understands. 
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf is expected to meet health unions. 
It's thought the Scottish government is prepared to divert more money from elsewhere in this year's budget to improve the current offer - without making a further raid on NHS spending.
Health unions are threatening a walk-out before Christmas unless the existing pay offer is improved. 
government offered a flat rate of £2,205 per person, backdated to April - an average salary increase of 7% with the lowest paid gaining more than 11%. 
However unions have described it as a real-terms pay cut as inflation - the rate prices are rising - hit 11.1% in October.
Royal College of Nursing has asked for at least 5% above inflation. 
Unite, the GMB union and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy have also backed strike action. 
About 1,500 ambulance staff, including paramedics, who are members of Unite will take industrial action - including a work-to-rule and overtime ban - on Friday. 
GMB Scotland's members in the Scottish Ambulance Service will strike on 28 November.
It is understood that Unison - Scotland's largest health union - has also rejected the latest pay offer and will now ballot its 50,000 members on industrial action. 
government has previously said there is no more money for public sector pay rises and that a strike would be ""catastrophic"".
Scottish ministers have repeatedly said there is no more money in this year's budget for improved public sector pay deals. 
rikes in the NHS during this period of enormous pressure on the service would be ""catastrophic"". 
In other words, they have little option but to make a fresh effort to avert industrial action. 
Nicola Sturgeon appealed to the UK government - which faces a similar dispute - to come up with more cash. 
While the chancellor found some extra cash for the NHS and social care over the next couple of years, his autumn statement did not contain new money for use now. 
means the Scottish government will have to divert cash already allocated for other things. 
It's not clear how much they've found or exactly where it's coming from but it's not thought to involve a fresh raid on NHS spending. "
health	Covid in China: People rush to book travel as borders finally reopen	"Chinese people have rushed to book overseas travel after Beijing announced it would reopen its borders next month.
Passport applications for Chinese citizens wishing to travel internationally will resume from 8 January, the immigration administration said.
It follows an announcement on Monday that ended almost three years of strict quarantine rules for arrivals.
ravel sites have since reported a spike in traffic.
But Chinese tourists will not have unfettered access to all countries.
Officials in the US are considering new restrictions on travellers from China due to concerns about a surge in cases and a lack of transparency from the Chinese government.
""There are mounting concerns in the international community on the ongoing Covid-19 surges in China and the lack of transparent data, including viral genomic sequence data,"" US officials said in a statement quoted by news agencies.
""Without this data, it is becoming increasingly difficult for public health officials to ensure that they will be able to identify any potential new variants and take prompt measures to reduce the spread.""
Japan - one of the most popular destinations for Chinese travellers - has announced that all travellers from China must show a negative Covid test on arrival, or quarantine for seven days, because of the surge in cases there.
India has also said travellers from China (as well as some other countries) must show a negative Covid test when they arrive - though this was announced before Beijing's easing of restrictions.
g of travel rules in China - the last part of the country's zero-Covid policy - comes as the country battles a new wave of infections.
Resentment against the government's policy - which sparked rare public protests against President Xi Jinping in November - led to a relaxation of Covid restrictions across the country.
But an increase in Covid cases followed, with reports of hospitals overwhelmed and a shortage of drugs.
uncement on outbound travel on Tuesday came after Monday's news, which axed quarantine rules for travellers arriving in China. It also scrapped a cap on the daily number of flights.
On the same day, the National Health Commission announced that Covid would be formally downgraded to a Class B infectious disease on 8 January.
Before the relaxation of travel rules, people were strongly discouraged from travelling abroad. The sale of outbound group and package travel was banned, according to marketing solutions company Dragon Trail International.
Within half an hour of Monday's notice that China's borders would reopen, data from travel site Trip.com - cited in Chinese media - showed searches for popular destinations had increased ten-fold year-on-year. 
Macau, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand and South Korea were the most popular destinations.
In addition, Chinese travel agency Qunar saw flight enquiries on its website increase seven-fold within the first 15 minutes after the announcement, the China Daily reports.
Before the pandemic, the number of outbound tourists from China stood at 155 million in 2019, according to Statista. This number dropped to 20 million in 2020.
r, some people in China will hope to visit family and loved ones during Chinese New Year, which begins on 22 January.
But inside China, there has been a mixed reaction.
""I'm happy about it but also speechless. If we're doing this [reopening] anyway - why did I have to suffer all the daily Covid tests and lockdowns this year?"" said Rachel Liu, who lives in Shanghai.
She said she had endured three months of lockdown in April - but nearly everyone in her family had become infected in recent weeks.
She said her parents, grandparents and partner - living across three different cities in Xi'an, Shanghai and Hangzhou - had all come down with fever last week.
Many have also expressed concern online about borders reopening as Covid cases peak.
""Why can't we wait until this wave passes to open up? The medical workers are already worn out, and old people won't survive two infections in one month,"" read one top-liked comment on Weibo.
People in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, which experience chilly temperatures in the winter, say they're running out of flu and cold medicine. 
It's feared that hundreds of deaths may be going unreported as crematoriums are overwhelmed. 
In the capital, Beijing, authorities say they are planning to distribute the Pfizer tablets, Paxlovid, in order to try to reduce the severity of infections. But health centres contacted by The Global Times on Monday said the drug had yet to be delivered.
On Monday, President Xi issued his first remarks on the changes, calling on officials to do what was ""feasible"" to save lives.
China's about-turn has put Mr Xi in a tough spot. He was the driving force behind zero-Covid, which many blamed for restricting people's lives excessively and crippling the economy. 
But having abandoned it, analysts say he now has to take responsibility for the huge wave of infections and hospital admissions. Many have questioned why the country was not better prepared.

health	NI health: Northern Ireland is 'getting the health service we pay for'	"People in Northern Ireland are getting ""the health service we pay for"", the Department of Health's top civil servant Peter May has said.
He warned that without sustained investment people must ""recalibrate"" their expectations on service delivery.
rmanent secretary said fundamental questions must be addressed on the health service's future.
It comes as the Royal College of Nursing confirmed its plans to take strike action before Christmas.
On Friday, the trade union said its members in Northern Ireland, England and Wales would walk out on 15 and 20 December in a dispute about pay and staffing levels.
Mr May told the annual conference of the Northern Ireland Branch of the Healthcare Financial Management Association in Belfast it was getting harder to deliver what people needed.
""With the resources available to us, we are finding it increasingly difficult to deliver the health and social care system needed to meet all the demands of the population,"" he said.
""We all want to get back to a health service that provides timely care to everyone who needs it when they need it.
""That's far from guaranteed. Without sustained funding, it will be impossible,"" he continued.
Mr May told delegates that while ""many actions"" could be taken to ""make health and social care more efficient and effective….we must not pretend that efficiencies alone will close the widening gap between demand and supply.""
Mr May added: ""The reality is also that our ageing population and advances in medical science mean the gap between demand and capacity is growing year-on-year, winter-on-winter.""
r civil servant also told the conference ""it remains the case that the overwhelming majority of the most sick patients receive very high quality care.""
""At the same time, many people requiring less time-critical care are having to wait much longer - often in pain and discomfort. This is not the level of care that the public expects or that any of us wants to provide.""
He also told stressed to delegates the ""importance of not losing hope in face of the current challenges"".
Revealing details about its strike action, Pat Cullen, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said nursing staff ""had enough of being taken for granted, enough of low pay and unsafe staffing levels, enough of not being able to give our patients the care they deserve"".
Under trade union laws, the union has to ensure life-preserving care is provided during the strikes, which will last from 08:00 to 20:00 GMT."
health	Fauci: 'Low-life trolls harass my wife and kids'	"America's top infectious disease expert, who became the face of the pandemic with his daily television updates, has spoken out against ""low-life"" trolls harassing his wife and children, figuring out where they live and their phone numbers. 
""I have good security protection, but I really think it's so cowardly to harass people who are completely uninvolved, including my children,"" Dr Anthony Fauci told the BBC's Americast podcast. 
Dr Fauci, who became a target for online conspiracy movements after advising on the Covid-19 pandemic, said he tries his best not to be distracted by online hate that ""takes away from your ability to do your job"". 
As chief medical adviser to the US President he was the country's top medical expert and the voice of the government's pandemic response, during both the Trump and Biden administration, providing daily updates to the American public, encouraging mask use and vaccination. 
He frequently clashed with former President Donald Trump, who once threatened to fire him.
Conspiracy theorists accused Dr Fauci of playing a key role in a sinister plot to control and harm people with Covid-19 and vaccines, contrary to the evidence. 
wo people have previously been arrested and imprisoned in the US for what Dr Fauci described as ""credible attempts on [his] life."" 
He warned about a ""tsunami of misinformation and disinformation"" in his country, including on social media. But he refused to comment on Twitter's recent decision to stop labelling and removing Covid-19 misinformation, because he feared being accused of ""trying to suppress people's freedom of speech"".  
81-year-old is stepping down as chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden this month and head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). 
Dr Fauci has served under seven presidents, including Joe Biden, Donald Trump and Barack Obama, starting with Republican Ronald Reagan during the HIV AIDS epidemic.
But he was thrust further into the public eye during the Covid-19 pandemic, where decisions he and other scientific advisers made about restrictions and medical advice were under scrutiny. 
At times, he clashed with Donald Trump's approach to managing the pandemic.
Watch: Key moments: Fauci and the pandemic
He said it was not easy to publicly disagree with a sitting president and that it ""generated an extraordinary amount of hostility"" from ""far-right"" activists in the US. 
When asked whether the severity of lockdowns in some American states was misjudged, Dr Fauci disagreed. 
He dismissed the approach taken by Sweden, which did not immediately go into lockdown, but advocated voluntary social distancing.
""I would not under any circumstances adopt the Swedish model because if you look at the deaths and hospitalisations in Sweden compared to other Scandinavian countries, it's much, much worse,"" Dr Fauci told Americast. 
Dr Fauci, who will turn 82 on 24 December, said he will continue to work in healthcare.

health	Lioness Demi Stokes opens up about her crazy entrance into the world	"Lioness Demi Stokes who was born 10 weeks early weighing 3lb (1.3kg) has shared her birth story to show premature babies are strong.
Manchester City and England star said she had a ""crazy entrance into the world"" after being born in a toilet.
30-year-old footballer has opened up to mark World Prematurity Day.
""I probably was quite small when I started playing football, but it just meant I had to work a little bit harder,"" she said.
""And actually, once I did fill out, I probably overtook the bigger guys,"" said Stokes, who joined Sunderland's youth academy aged eight and by 16 was playing in the first team.
""I think that's what I'd say to other parents now - don't worry if they're small and if they might be a bit late to develop, because we catch up. 
""We need to let little premmie babies know they are strong and... very robust.""
Stokes and her partner Katie Harrington have a six-month-old son, Harlen, who was born six weeks early weighing 5lbs (2.3kg).
He needed to spend a week in hospital after being born via emergency Caesarean.
She said it was only since becoming a parent it had sunk in what an anxious time it must have been for her own mum.
""But it's interesting because when I do speak to my mum about it, she doesn't ever say, 'Oh, it was horrendous'... I feel like she must have blocked it out.""
She said she had two other siblings who were also premature and while they were healthy, ""everyone's experience isn't the same"".
Stokes said she had shared her story to help start conversations around what experiencing a premature or difficult birth could be like for those going through it.
""It's important we talk about it,"" she said. 
Her partner also had pre-eclampsia, which she became seriously unwell with.
""It was really scary... I remember thinking, 'Demi, just have a poker face' - because if I crumble, I'm not going to help Katie,"" she said. 
She believed the skills she learned as a footballer, in terms of mental focus and staying calm under pressure, helped in the moment. 
""But inside, I was panicking and I was worried, definitely,"" she shared. ""I think not until after, when she came home, then I was like, 'You were really poorly, you were really unwell'.""
Stokes added that both were doing well now - and despite being ""a little early"", Harlen's ""really filled out and thriving"".

health	Cornwall to trial at home health checks	"A landmark trial aimed at making it easier for patients to carry out health checks has been launched in Cornwall.
Patients will complete online questionnaires, take blood samples at home, and complete blood pressure checks at a pharmacy or GP surgery.
rial is the first of its kind and comes as part of the government's plan to digitalise the NHS Health Check.
Public health minister Neil O'Brien said the checks would ""reduce pressure"" on services.
NHS Health Check is a health check-up for adults in England aged 40 to 74 designed to prevent stroke, kidney disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some types of dementia.
A total of 15 million people are eligible for free NHS Health Checks in England, according to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).
ks are currently delivered face-to-face by GPs, but many parts of the check can be done without a GP.
w trial aims to free up time for more urgent GP appointments, the DHSC said.
More than 2,000 people from three GP surgeries across Cornwall are being invited to take part in the trial - only those whose results indicate an underlying health condition will be followed-up by their GP.
results of the trial will help inform the design and development of the new national NHS Digital Health Check.
Minister for public health Neil O'Brien said: ""Innovation is key to a modern, forward looking National Health Service, and this trial will help us understand what a new digital NHS Health Check could look like in the years to come.
""During the pandemic people got used to doing tests at home and getting their results online, so this trial is an opportunity for us to apply some of the lessons we learnt during Covid and improve the way we deliver healthcare.""
Dr Andy Sant, managing director of NHS Cornwall's north and east integrated care area said he was ""delighted"" patients in Cornwall were being given the first opportunity to access the digital health checks.
According to the DHSC, the offer of NHS Health Checks has been historically lower in Cornwall than most local authorities in England.
During 2019-20, over 13,400 checks were offered and over 6,900 were completed, but in 2021-22 approximately 4,300 were offered and just over 1,900 were completed.
Cornwall councillor Dr Andy Virr, portfolio holder for adults and public health, said it was ""great news"" the trial was being carried out in the area.

health	Urine test hope for early liver cancer diagnosis	"Scientists in Scotland have made a discovery that could lead to a urine test for liver cancer.
Staff at the Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute in Glasgow have identified a metabolite never found before in mammals which could indicate the presence of the disease.
re is currently no definitive urine test for any type of cancer. 
Most patients are diagnosed through surgery, ultrasound scans or blood tests which require a trip to hospital.
ment could lead to a urine test being developed to detect the beta-catenin mutated form of liver cancer after the researchers discovered the metabolite in mice.
Dr Saverio Tardito, who is leading the project, said the number of people with liver cancer was expected to rise and new tools to detect and treat it earlier were needed.
""We were excited to discover this new metabolite which had never been described before in mammals,"" he said.
""It is a good candidate for diagnostic testing as it's specific to a particular type of liver cancer, can be easily detected in urine, and could potentially be used as a marker to monitor the growth of tumours.""
for the test was discovered by a team exploring a protein known to be prevalent in liver cancer - glutamine synthetase.
While studying this enzyme in normal liver tissue in mice, the team discovered a new metabolite not previously identified in mammals which is produced by the enzyme.
It appeared in high levels in mice with a specific type of liver tumour and the levels rose as the tumour grew.
metabolite, called N5-methylglutamine, also appeared in urine when the tumour-promoting mutation of the gene beta-catenin is present, meaning it could be used to identify patients with this specific type of cancer.
Dr Tardito said: ""We now plan further studies to investigate how early in liver cancer the metabolite appears, to identify how early a urine test could reliably diagnose the disease.""
Every year in the UK there are around 6,200 new liver cancer cases, with around 610 of those in Scotland.
Liver cancer rates are higher in Scotland than the UK average and around a quarter of liver cancer patients have the beta-catenin mutated form of the disease.
Diagnosis of liver cancer is often late, with many patients diagnosed only when already receiving treatment for existing diseases such as cirrhosis or fatty liver disease.
But early, non-invasive testing could help catch the disease earlier, increase the effectiveness of existing treatments and boost development of new therapies. "
health	Speedo Mick set to start final fundraising walk	"A fundraiser famous for walking in his tight blue Everton FC swimming trunks is set to start his last big challenge.
In eight years Michael Cullen, also known as Speedo Mick, has raised more than £800,000 through his challenges.
58-year-old said he hoped his final walk - spanning 1,000 miles (1,600km) from John O'Groats to Land's End - would take the total to more than £1m.
""That would just be a perfect ending to the Speedo Mick stomps, wouldn't it, a million quid?"" Mr Cullen said.
Mick hopes to walk at least 15 miles a day for up to three months in aid of The SpeedoMick Foundation.
rity will give grants to small charities that support mental health awareness, disadvantaged young people, and the homeless.
Mick first earned his nickname after fundraising £30,000 swimming the English Channel in 2014.
wo years later, he raised more than £50,000 for a Liverpool hospice by walking from Everton's Goodison Park stadium to Wembley Stadium.
In 2019 and 2020 he raised more than £300,000 after walking from John O'Groats to Land's End and in 2021 his 2,500 mile (4,023 km) Giving Back Tour raised almost £180,000.
""It's bittersweet,"" he said of his various challenges. ""It's given me a purpose to be busy and to be positive and to give back as well.
""And every single person who's donated, shared my posts, said 'keep going'... every single person who has done that for me over the last eight years, they've all been part of this journey.
Mick, who has previously shared details of his own personal mental health challenges, has said his fundraising was a way to thank people who had helped him.
Speedo Mick spoke to BBC Breakfast about his battle with depression
On his final walk, starting on 29 December, he plans to scale the Britain's three national mountain peaks - Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike, and Mount Snowdon - along the way.
While admitting he was not quite yet feeling up to his last trek, Mick said putting on his Speedos lets him ""get into the groove"".
""I get the energy from them,"" he said.
""When I get in my kit and I've got my bag on and all my flags are flapping about in the wind, that's when the challenge begins.""

health	Covid in China: US imposes Covid testing for visitors from China	"US has become the latest country to impose Covid testing on visitors from China, after Beijing announced it would reopen borders next week.
Italy, Japan, Taiwan and India also announced mandatory tests, but Australia and UK said there were no new rules for travellers from China.
After three years of being closed to the world, China will let people travel more freely from 8 January.
But the country's ongoing Covid surge has sparked wariness. 
China is reporting about 5,000 cases a day, but analysts say such numbers are vastly undercounted - and the daily case load may be closer to a million. Hospitals are overwhelmed and residents are struggling to find basic medicines, according to reports. 
On Wednesday, the US said a lack of ""adequate and transparent"" Covid data in China had contributed to the decision to require Covid tests from 5 January for travellers entering the country from China, Hong Kong and Macau.
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this was needed ""to help slow the spread of the virus as we work to identify... any potential new variants that may emerge"".
But Beijing's foreign ministry on Wednesday had said coronavirus rules should only be instated on a ""scientific"" basis and accused Western countries and media of  ""hyping up"" the situation.
Some people reacted angrily on China's censored social media. 
""I thought all of the foreign countries had opened up. Isn't this racism?"" read one comment that was liked 3,000 times on Weibo. The US has said testing is required of anyone coming from China, or via a third country, regardless of nationality.
But others said they understood the reason for the conditions: ""This is nothing compared to all the restrictions we had for people coming into China,"" one user wrote. 
Beijing only announced on Monday its decision to end quarantine for arrivals - effectively reopening travel in and out of the country for the first time since March 2020. Until this week, anyone entering China had to undergo quarantine in state facilities. 
Before the pandemic, China had been the world's largest outbound tourism market. But it's unclear how many Chinese people will travel abroad after 8 January given that the number of flights are limited, and many citizens need to renew their passports. 
rnational community's reaction has varied with the UK and Australia saying they were monitoring China's Covid situation but were not planning on announcing new testing requirements.  
Others have moved swiftly to announce restrictions:
European Commission said its health security committee would convene on Thursday to discuss ""possible measures for a coordinated EU approach"" to China's Covid surge. 
But Italy, an EU member state and an epicentre of the virus in late 2019 and 2020, said it was moving first to ""ensure the surveillance and identification"" of any new variants of the virus.
Flights arriving in Milan this week were already testing passengers from China. Authorities found 52% of passengers were infected with Covid on one flight that landed on 26 December.
Initial tests of Covid-positive travellers arriving from China showed that 15 of them had Omicron variants that were already present in Italy, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said. She described the news as quite reassuring.
Italy is one of 26 European countries in the border-free Schengen zone and Ms Meloni is calling for EU-wide testing of Chinese passengers, arguing that Italy's own measures might otherwise be ineffective. 
China's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that ""currently the development of China's epidemic situation is overall predictable and under control"". 
However, the true toll of daily cases and deaths in China is unknown as officials have stopped requiring cases to be reported, and changed classifications for Covid deaths. On Sunday, officials said they would also stop releasing daily case counts.
""The infection surge in China is on expected lines,"" Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, an Indian epidemiologist and health systems specialist told the BBC in a recent interview. 
""If you have a susceptible population that is not exposed to the virus, cases will rise. Nothing has changed for the rest of the world.""
China's decision to reopen its borders marks the end of the country's controversial zero-Covid policy, which President Xi Jinping had personally endorsed. 
Even as the rest of the world transitioned to living with the virus, Beijing insisted on an eradication policy involving mass testing and stringent lockdowns.
my took a hit and people grew both exhausted and angry - in November, the frustration spilled onto the streets in rare protests against Mr Xi and his government. Week later, Beijing began to roll back the restrictions."
health	Assisted dying: 'I was arrested for taking someone to Dignitas'	"A retired NHS worker spent 19 hours in custody and was investigated by police for six months for chaperoning a woman to her assisted death in Switzerland.
Sue Lawford went with Sharon Johnston, who was in a wheelchair after a fall left her paralysed, to Dignitas from her home in mid Wales.
70-year-old said police, who arrested her the day after returning from Switzerland, were ""aggressive"".
Dyfed-Powys Police said assisting a suicide was a criminal offence.
force said a ""thorough criminal investigation"" was required to establish the facts but added that the case has been closed and no-one will face charges.
British law states anyone who is said to have encouraged or assisted the suicide or attempted suicide of another person can be jailed for up to 14 years.
Baroness Ilora Finlay, a former Royal Society of Medicine president and professor of palliative care, said the law must protect vulnerable people.
Ms Johnson, 60, who had no immediate family following the death of her parents and brother, went to Switzerland to die six months after the former pub landlady and betting shop worker told a BBC TV programme she planned to spend £14,000 to end her life.
Mrs Lawford, a retired GP surgery manager, did not know Sharon and only met her once before they travelled, but agreed to help her as a member of group My Death, My Decision, which supports changes to the UK law on assisted dying.
Retired NHS worker Sue Lawford spent 19 hours in custody
Mrs Lawford admitted ""it wasn't the easiest decision"" to help Ms Johnson, a tetraplegic, get to Dignitas but she said she ""couldn't hand on heart come up with a good enough reason to say I wouldn't help"".
Ms Johnston travelled from her home in Cardigan, Ceredigion, in a disabled taxi to London's Heathrow Airport on 14 February for the journey to Dignitas, picking up Ms Lawford in Cardiff on the way.
""Sharon was so rational, pragmatic and down to earth about the whole thing,"" said Mrs Lawford.
""She had been getting rid of stuff to the charity shops and things like that. There was this feeling that it was all quite imminent.""
But not long after they set off, Ms Johnson received her first call from police. Mrs Lawford said she believed the carers who went to Sharon's home four times a day had reported her missing. 
She said she thought Mrs Johnston received two calls from the police and one from social services on the journey to the airport, each time Mrs Johnston told the authorities that she was OK. 
Ceredigion council has said it would not comment on individual cases but Mrs Lawford said those calls were ""stressful"".
""We didn't really talk about it in the taxi but I think we both felt that any minute we would see a blue light and we would be stopped on the motorway,""  she added.
""She was worried that she wouldn't be able to go through with it.""
Once they arrived at Dignitas, Ms Johnston was assessed by a doctor and psychiatrist on whether she was able to make a rational decision about ending her life.
But Mrs Lawford said armed police then turned up.
""There was a knock on the door and looking out through the blinds, we could see it was the Swiss police,"" she added.
""The police here had asked the Swiss police to intervene. So more stress for Sharon. It was extremely upsetting and frightening.
""The police were very business-like but Swiss police are armed for a start, and it's not something we are used to seeing in this country.
""They were perfectly polite and asked lots of questions, both separately and together. I can only assume that they were reassured. 
""Sharon was very calm and rational and the police eventually left and must have reported back to the police in the UK.""
following day, Ms Johnston ended her life at the clinic and Mrs Lawford returned home.
She was woken early the following morning at about 05:30 GMT by banging on her front door.  
""The dog went absolutely berserk,"" Mrs Lawford recalled. ""My husband and I nearly jumped out of our skins. He went down to answer the door and just called up and said 'Sue you better come down, it's the police'.""
As she stood in her pyjamas, Mrs Lawford was told she was being arrested and said an officer led her to a police van and made her sit in the cage at the back.
She said she was held for a total of 19 hours, 16 of them in a police cell, before being told that she was being released under investigation.
Dyfed-Powys Police said: ""It is a criminal offence in the UK to encourage or assist in the suicide or attempted suicide of another person. 
""The circumstances of such cases increase the risk of vulnerable people being exploited and others making financial gain,"" the force said a statement.
""A thorough criminal investigation is required to establish the facts of each case, requiring action to secure evidence that may be lost as time passes and prevent opportunities to dispose of relevant evidence. 
""Following such an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Sharon Johnston the matter has been closed.""
Officers have said the two people who were arrested as part of the investigation have been told they ""face no further action"".
figures from prosecutors suggested just four cases of assisted suicide have been prosecuted in the UK, with the majority not leading to charges.
Mrs Lawford will speak at an event in Westminster Hall on Tuesday organised by My Death, My Decision, which wants the law changed so that people ""of sound mind"" who are ""terminally ill or incurably suffering"" can be allowed to end their own lives.
f assisted dying has been debated in Parliament numerous times and the latest Assisted Dying Bill, which proposed allowing terminally ill adults to be helped to end their own life, was discussed in its second House of Lords reading last year but failed to make it to law.
Campaigners against the proposed change raised concerns it could leave some patients vulnerable to coercion.
Cardiff cancer hospital consultant Baroness Finlay worried that once implemented legislation could expand to include the disabled, children, the mentally ill or those suffering trauma.
She said: ""If you are considering legislation you must think who are you putting at risk.""
She added she thought it was ""dangerous"" to put doctors in a position where they could end lives and added they should be working to improve, not shorten them. 
""The role of the law has to be to protect everyone who is vulnerable and it has to look to protect the most vulnerable from being pressurised into things that they should somehow end their lives,"" she said.
""That is the law at the moment and the director of public prosecutions has very clear guidance as to which cases should be pursued and which shouldn't.
""Sadly there are always people who, at a time of something awful happening, feel complete despair.
""But we know that with appropriate support and help, they come out the other side and often can live very well and go on to be glad that they are still alive. It is too dangerous to licence a doctor to provide lethal drugs to their patients."" 
Assisted dying has been decriminalised in several European countries, including Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands while a bill to legalise assisted dying has now been introduced in Scotland, which could bring about changes next year.
British Medical Association has now moved to a position of neutrality on assisted dying. 
MPs last voted on changes to the right to die in England and Wales in 2015 and the UK government said any change to the law ""in an area of such sensitivity and importance"" is for individual MPs to consider rather than government.
""Our sympathies remain with the families and loved ones affected by these deeply upsetting cases,"" the Ministry of Justice added.
Mrs Lawford said she understands the police were doing their job when they questioned her but feels the law should change - and hopes she is never asked to accompany anyone on a trip like this again.
""I have not actually talked about it to many people but when I do I don't sleep very well for a couple of nights."" she said. ""It is a massive thing.""

health	China zero Covid: Violent protests in Guangzhou put curbs under strain	"Crowds of residents in southern China's industrial metropolis Guangzhou have escaped a compulsory lockdown and clashed with police, as anger at strict coronavirus curbs boiled over.
Dramatic footage shows some tearing down Covid control barriers. Riot teams have now been deployed in the area.  
It follows Guangzhou's worst Covid outbreak since the pandemic began.
Amid bad economic figures, China's zero Covid policy is under enormous strain.
uilding in the city's Haizhu District, which is under stay-at-home orders.
rea is home to many poorer itinerant labourers. They have complained of not being paid if they are unable to turn up for work, and of food shortages and skyrocketing prices while living under Covid control measures. 
For several nights, they'd been tussling with the white-clad Covid prevention enforcement officials, and then overnight on Monday the anger suddenly exploded onto the streets of Guangzhou with a mass act of defiance.
Again, unsubstantiated rumours have played a role. Stories have spread that the testing companies are faking PCR results to artificially boost the number of infections in order to make more money.
In the north of the country, the coronavirus rumour mill is also building pressure.
Officials in Hebei Province announced that the city of Shijiazhuang would halt mass testing. But this led to speculation that the population was going to be used, guinea-pig-style, to monitor what would happen if the virus was allowed to spread unchecked. 
Discussion of this has appeared on social media platforms under the hashtag #ShijiazhuangCovidprevention.
Many panicking locals have stockpiled Chinese medicines which are said to help with Covid infection. Supplies in the city are said to have virtually run out for the moment.
A similar viral rumour led to the mass breakout of workers at the Foxconn complex in the central city of Zhengzhou two weeks ago, which has hit the global supply of Apple iPhones.
Local governments across China are struggling to maintain a zero-Covid approach without trashing their economies. The latest official factory output and retails sales figures show the crushing impact of the pandemic and the government's policy response to it.
re are no provinces at all which have reported zero cases in recent days.
Around 20 million people in the heart of western China's mega city of Chongqing have been placed under a type of lockdown being referred to ironically by people as ""voluntary static management"". This is because, though there has been no official announcement, they've been told to remain indoors by community officials. 
Online there have been jokes that the Chongqing government didn't want to announce a mass lockdown on the same day that measures easing zero-Covid rules across China were revealed.
Because Covid amelioration still dominates life here, even a small shift in the way it is being administered can cause consternation and panic.
At the beginning of this week, officials in Beijing's Chaoyang district decided to close many of the street-side testing booths and move them into housing compounds. There was a sudden cut in the number of PCR stations. The problem is that many office buildings require a daily result, or you can't enter. 
So at the booths that were open, the queues were enormous.
From the workers stuck in Tibet who protested to leave Lhasa, to the lockdown of the entire region of Xinjiang, zero-Covid is not going smoothly.
A series of changes announced last week slightly toning down the rules were seen as a sign that more easing was possible down the road. But even if the government is considering this, it may not be soon enough."
health	Doncaster surgery sends cancer text instead of festive message	"A GP surgery accidentally told patients they had aggressive lung cancer instead of wishing them a merry Christmas. 
Askern Medical Practice sent the text message to people registered with the surgery in Doncaster on 23 December. 
Sarah Hargreaves, who was waiting for medical test results, said she ""broke down"" when she received the text, only to be later told it was sent in error.
group which runs the surgery said nobody was available for comment. The centre has almost 8,000 patients.
first text told recipients they had ""aggressive lung cancer with metastases"", a type of secondary malignant growth.
It directed patients to fill out a DS1500 form, which allows people with terminal diseases to claim certain benefits.
However, about an hour later people received a second text telling them it was an error and it was meant to wish them a merry Christmas instead.
Ms Hargreaves said after she received the original text while she was out shopping, she ""felt sick to my teeth and broke down"".
She added: ""I had just had a mole removed and was awaiting a result from a biopsy and I had been to hospital as my smear test came back abnormal, so yes, I was very worried.""
Despite repeated calls to the surgery, she said she struggled to get through to speak to someone.
Carl Chegwin, another of the surgery's users who, along with his mother, received the text, said he was left upset by the out-of-the-blue message which ""was enough to break someone"".
""The first thing I thought was, 'is this some kind of sick joke?'"" Mr Chegwin said.
""It completely took me by surprise... It's not often I go to the doctors, then out of the blue, it's cancer. I'm sat there scratching my head thinking, 'I do smoke, do they know something I don't?'""
""They've just told people a few days before Christmas they've got terminal lung cancer. They can't do that.""
Meanwhile, a woman, who asked not to be named, said she was left feeling ""very worried"" about the text, with family members recently having tests about ongoing chest issues.
""I rang the doctors but on hold as usual. So, I walked round as I live around the corner and there were, I'd say, six people all there panicking as they had got the same text.""
xt apologised for the error, with some patients getting repeat messages from the surgery.
""What if that message was meant for someone, and then they are told it's a Christmas message, then again told, 'oh no, that was actually meant for you'?"" Mr Chegwin asked.

health	French vote for right to abortion in constitution	"France's National Assembly has backed a bid to enshrine the right to abortion in the constitution, prompted largely by increased restrictions elsewhere.
Lawmakers voted by a large majority to include a clause guaranteeing ""the effectiveness and equal access to the right to end pregnancy voluntarily"".
Left-wing MP Mathilde Panot, who is behind the change, said it was to protect against the ""backsliding"" seen in the US and Poland.
But the bill will face a tough passage.
Last month the upper house, the Senate, rejected a similar proposal and is thought unlikely to back the new amendment. Right-wing parties - which dominate the Senate - argue that abortion rights are not under threat in France.
A change of constitution would also have to go to a referendum, although opinion polls suggest more than 80% of French voters are behind it.
Ms Panot's amendment went through after securing the support of MPs in Emmanuel Macron's ruling Renaissance party, but a reference to the right to contraception was scrapped.
Macron MP Aurore Bergé had been due to present her own abortion amendment next week but withdrew it, telling MPs how her mother had endured an abortion without anaesthetic before it was legalised in 1974.
""The question of access to abortion and of protecting it isn't a whim; it shouldn't be politicised; it's not a matter of party politics,"" she said.
Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti also backed changing the constitution and praised the ""historic"" vote.
Last February, the French parliament voted to extend the legal timeframe for abortion from 12 to 14 weeks, similar to neighbouring Spain. It is lower than other European countries, including Sweden, the Netherlands, England, Wales and Scotland. 
Ms Panot dedicated Thursday's vote to women in the US, Poland and Hungary. Her push to change constitution was triggered by a vote in the US Supreme Court to end the national guarantee to abortion access, overturning the landmark Roe v Wade ruling in 1973.
rteen US states have since begun enforcing abortion bans, while voters in states including California backed proposals this month to enshrine the right to abortion in their constitution.
Poland has a near-total abortion ban and this year began enforcing a ruling that terminating pregnancies with foetal defects was unconstitutional.
Meanwhile, Hungary's nationalist government recently tightened restrictions on abortion to require pregnant women to prove a foetus's sign of life before requesting a termination."
politics	Would pay demands cost an extra £28bn?	"Faced with a wave of strikes this winter, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was asked what more he could do to head them off.
Mr Sunak said the government had accepted the recommendations of the public sector pay review bodies but added: ""What I'm not going to do is ask ordinary families up and down the country to pay an extra £1,000 a year to meet the pay demands of the union bosses.""
Health Secretary Steve Barclay has also used this figure, telling BBC Breakfast on 7 December: ""If everyone in the public sector had a pay rise in line with inflation, it would cost an extra £28bn, an extra £1,000 per household.""
But, in terms of the current dispute, these figures look too high. 
ublic sector pay bill for all 5.7 million employees was around £233bn last year.
Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts average inflation for 2022-23 of about 10%. A rise for public sector workers in line with this would cost about £23bn.
re are 28 million households in the UK, so that's about £820 per household.
But there's something else to consider, as Ben Zaranko from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has pointed out.
""The government was already planning to give non-zero pay awards when it set out its spending plans last autumn,"" he told Reality Check.
It was already budgeting for a 3% average pay rise for the public sector for 2022-23 - remember, both the prime minister and the health secretary talked about how much ""extra"" would have to be paid. 
Once this is factored in, the IFS estimates that increasing it to match inflation of 10% would cost about £18bn - around £640 per household. 
And there's also the question of the tax public sector workers would be paying if they got an inflation-linked pay deal.
If it cost the government £18bn, it would be getting some of this back through tax - roughly a third - bringing the bill down further.
On 7 December, we asked the Treasury how it came up with the £28bn and £1,000 per family (or household) figures. 
On 9 December, it said they were calculated for an inflation-linked pay deal in 2023-24, whereas our calculations are for 2022-23.
government got to its higher figure by:
We asked the government why its figures were for 2023-24, when the strikes and disputes are over pay settlements in the current year?
It said these were appropriate given that pay has been set for this year and we are nine months through the pay year for most workforces.
But some questions remain:
Why is the government taking an inflation figure from October 2022 and applying it to a pay deal in 2023-24?
Ben Zaranko, from the IFS, points out that CPI inflation is forecast by the OBR to average 5.5% in 2023/24. 
""So it doesn't make sense to apply the current rate of CPI inflation to a pay award next year"", he told us.
He suggested that the right number to use, under the government's methodology, would be ""more like £14 billion"".
And why would families be asked to pay ""an extra £1,000 a year""?
We don't know quite what Mr Sunak means by this. 
If he means an extra £1,000 in tax to fund this pay deal, it's worth pointing out that taxes such as income tax and national insurance are not evenly distributed throughout the population.
Some families don't pay any and the amount of tax paid by those who do, varies widely.

politics	Don't believe it's back to boring, says Laura Kuenssberg	"After the last few years - let alone the last few weeks - you can see why Michael Gove has said in a speech that he is grateful ""boring is back"". 
Mr Gove, who has returned to cabinet as levelling up secretary and appears on this week's programme, made the comments at the London Press Club awards.
You too might feel relief that the crazy period of the Truss administration has come to an end, and that in Rishi Sunak we seem to have a prime minister who doesn't revel in scrapes and scandals, who doesn't have making headlines at the top of his to-do list. Now who might we be talking about?  
One of his ministers told me that Sunak had ""ended the Tory psychodrama with a careful reshuffle of all the talents and a focus on delivery"", saying it was a sign of the recent turmoil that commentators see that as ""boring"". ""It's actually serious government,"" they added.
Another of his MPs, who did not find a berth in government, had a less flattering assessment, saying: ""He's managed to appoint to some of the dullest people in Parliament to ministerial jobs, so if anybody can succeed in being boring, it's some of these people."" Ouch!  
It is true that we are at the start of a very different era. From 2015 until last month at least one of our big political parties has been led by a deeply unconventional leader.
Jeremy Corbyn's time in office turned Labour upside down. Boris Johnson as the Tory boss provided a daily soap opera. 
Much of the soundtrack to the last seven years has been noisy internal chaos for one - or sometimes both - of Labour and the Conservatives.  
Sunak vs Starmer creates a different atmosphere altogether. The biggest beasts in our politics are now described by colleagues as ""sensible"" and ""measured"". They are both known by their teams to be extremely hard working and diligent.  
f-perpetuating Tory circus has gone, the ring master retired after the crowd didn't clamour for more. And as one government insider notes, both main party leaders ""are keen to establish themselves for their competence rather than political pyrotechnics"". But that is not the same as ""boring"" for several significant reasons. 
Firstly, we are not living in a time when things are ticking over nicely and government can just trundle along. The choices the new prime minister has to make about the economy are huge. 
Watch: Rishi Sunak's first PMQs in the top job... in 64 seconds
And it can't have escaped your notice - with Jeremy Hunt's sober tones, or countless briefings to journalists about the scary size of the black hole in the public finances - that cuts are coming, even if they end up being less grim than the scariest warnings suggest. 
We'll only know the likely result of those decisions when the chancellor gets to the despatch box on 17 November. We can be sure that it won't be pretty. But the decisions for Mr Sunak go way beyond the choices he has to make about the economy, and they are certainly not ""boring"". 
With millions on waiting lists, social care creaking, the risk of blackouts this winter and climate change, choices have to be made fast on a vast range of issues, and those decisions will have massive consequences for us all. 
And while Mr Sunak's approach on the economy is widely known, his broader instincts are less well understood.  
job is huge, according to another government source, who says: ""We have to get five years' worth of work done in about two."" 
But will it be dull? They add: ""It will be calmer and more stable, but to say Sunak is boring is wrong. He actually has quite an innovative way of looking at things so will shake things up, but in a well thought through way.""  
's an optimistic way of looking at it. One Whitehall source describes him differently, as ""the least experienced prime minister we have had in recent history"". Additionally, as chancellor it was possible for him - as others before him - to stay out of sight for long periods of time.  
Successive new prime ministers and their teams have started out with the intention of being less visible, popping up less, determined to concentrate on the job and their priorities rather than get caught up in frippery or spend time on events that don't match their agenda. 
want to avoid the surreal spectacle of Tony Blair once giving a view on the fortunes of fictional Coronation Street character, Deirdre Rachid. If you are lucky enough not to remember this, it really did happen, as this BBC story from the time shows.  
But successive teams who have entered No 10 with that intention find out that in the real world, they can dictate and control far less than they hope. Life comes at them fast, 24 hours a day, from 360 degrees.  
Mr Sunak has discovered already this week with his first visit, to a hospital. 
re were planned images of him chatting to patients, showing empathy and giving a brief clip to broadcasters on the issues of the day - but it was memorable not because of that, but because a patient took him to task, wagging her finger at him for not paying nurses enough. That encounter was not boring.  
Rishi Sunak says it is right he ""focuses on the... pressing domestic challenges"" the UK faces in its economy rather than got to COP27.
And whether it's on health, the environment, welfare, foreign affairs or other issues, it is hard to know where the new prime minister's political reflexes will lie.  
A Whitehall source who has worked alongside him says he ""is sensible, but not a centrist"", and he may surprise some even of his own supporters by erring to the right.  
Politics is about principles, and we'd all want our leaders to be deeply serious about how they make decisions, but it is also about instinct.  
urce, who has served successive prime ministers, wonders if his character will be well suited for the crucible of Downing Street.
""Boris came to reasonable decisions, but made them in a crazy way and didn't stick to them, Liz neither made the right decisions nor made them in a sensible way,"" they said. 
""He [Sunak] will make them in a sensible way, and it will make a difference. But given the way he delves into detail, how will he cope with the span of the job? You can't do a spreadsheet on every issue when you are the prime minister.""
And while he might be generally seen as sensible, Mr Sunak has already willingly walked into a political controversy that is far from dull. 
He hired back Suella Braverman as home secretary just days after she had been fired for breaking the rules for ministers. She had used her personal email to send government documents to a colleague, and they also ended up with someone else by mistake.  
Holding his carefully constructed government together prevents a huge challenge for the new leader, and it's simply not clear yet if he has the political ability to do that with long-term success. Could anyone?  
Conservatives concluded, less than a week ago, that after all the drama, Mr Sunak was their best option. The impulse to survive after the trauma of the Truss explosion led them to choose the candidate closest to being seen as a safe pair of hands.  
With a smart team around him, a party exhausted by arguing with itself, and a personal reputation for being extremely capable and hardworking, that could turn out to be true.  
But there is nothing remotely guaranteed about that coming to pass, nor is there any certainty that the Sunak premiership will be a success. And however much Conservatives might hope for dull stability, it certainly will not be boring for the rest of us to find out.  "

politics	Qatar World Cup: Welsh government boycotts Wales-Iran game	"A Welsh government minister who was expected to attend Wales' World Cup match with Iran will stay at home due to recent protests in the country. 
It was the only group match in Qatar Deputy Sport Minister Dawn Bowden was due to go to. 
First Minister Mark Drakeford and Economy Minister Vaughan Gething are still attending other World Cup ties.
Qatar has faced criticism in the build-up to the tournament for multiple human rights concerns. 
ude its laws against same-sex relationships, as well as how it treats women and foreign workers. 
Welsh government said it will still attend matches with the US and England, where they say ministers can ""share our interests and values""
BBC Wales was told the decision was due to the recent events in Iran and was not related to the wider debate about whether the entire visit to Qatar was appropriate.
Ms Bowden could attend future matches if Wales advance beyond the group stage, but it is not confirmed.
match against Iran is taking place at 10:00 GMT on 25 November in Al-Rayyan. 
Iran has been criticised internationally for its response to protests sparked by the death of a young woman arrested by the country's morality police.
Welsh government said: ""Welsh ministers will be attending the Wales games against the USA and England, as these represent the most significant opportunities for us to raise the profile of Wales and make connections where we can share our interests and values.
""Ministers will have a full programme of events and meetings to take advantage of this unique opportunity. 
""Welsh ministers will not be attending the Iran game and will be supporting Wales from home.""
Mr Drakeford is expected to attend the fixture against the US, while Mr Gething is planning to go to the England game.
Some gay Welsh fans have said they will stay away from the tournament, and earlier this week Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey criticised Mark Drakeford's decision to go to the tournament.. 
His comments sparked a robust Twitter response from Plaid Cymru MS and Senedd presiding officer Elin Jones, who said it was ""absolutely"" right for Mr Drakeford to attend.
""Our football team is there, so should he be. None of us wanted Qatar to host,"" she said.
As well as supporting Wales' first World Cup appearance since 1958, the Welsh government wants to use the event to raise the country's profile on the world stage.
Mr Drakeford's stance contradicts that of UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who is boycotting the event.
In September, Mr Gething told the Senedd that he, Mr Drakeford and Ms Bowden would attend a ""range of events"", as well as ""each of Wales' group games against the USA, Iran and England"".
Asked if he had considered a boycott, he said: ""We've considered all options, but we think it's the right thing for ministers to go, to support our team, and to make the very best of the opportunity that it is, both in terms of what it does for Wales on the stage, but also in that positive point about projecting and being proud of our values today.""
On Thursday a senior Welsh Labour MP, Rhondda's Chris Bryant, retweeted a report extremely critical of the treatment of LGBT people in Qatar, said: ""This is why no UK officials should be going to the World Cup.""
He did not name any of the Welsh ministers attending.
One Labour politician told BBC Wales they thought Mr Drakeford should not be attending: ""But I get why he is going for Wales"".
But they criticised the planned attendance of two other ministers as a ""pointless waste of money"".
Another Labour elected politician said while as a football fan they were happy that Mr Drakeford was attending, as someone who cared about human rights they were not.
Some Labour backbench Senedd members defended the trip.
Hefin David, Caerphilly MS, said while the event should have never been held in Qatar ""there are good reasons for Wales' government"" to be at the tournament.
John Griffiths, MS for Newport East, said: ""This is an opportunity that might not come along again for some time.""
Welsh Conservative sport spokesman Tom Giffard said: ""The Labour party can't quite decide whether or not they are going to be attending the Qatar World Cup. The hypocrisy is clear for all to see.""
He added that he hoped Mr Drakeford would still go to Qatar: ""It is right however, that the Welsh team are fully supported in their first World Cup since the 1950s.""
Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: ""Iran's human rights record is atrocious and we welcome this [decision]. 
""However, Qatar's is equal as abysmal and the Welsh government shouldn't be sending any Ministers to Qatar itself."""
politics	The local battles behind Tory housing divisions	"""We don't have enough new, purpose-built homes for people in my situation""
government has agreed to water down housing targets for local councils in the face of a rebellion from nearly 60 of its own MPs. But not everyone is happy - some Tories are worried this could lead to fewer homes being built and make it even harder for people to get on the housing ladder. At a local level, new developments provoke passionate views on both sides. 
""Unless I'm prepared to move 100 miles north of here then it's really unlikely I'll be able to get on the housing ladder,"" says Sheldon Allen. 
21-year-old, who is president of Reading University's Students' Union and a Labour activist, is currently renting a room in the town centre for £625 a month.
With bills to pay on top of that he says ""it's a real struggle to make ends meet"".
Sheldon thinks building more homes would help bring down the cost of renting and buying. 
""Ultimately I don't think we have enough new, purpose-built homes for people in my situation and others like me,"" he says.
But in the nearby borough of Wokingham in Berkshire, some locals are angry about the idea of more homes being built in the area. 
""I'm not against houses per se. We've had a lot of housing development in this area,"" says Paul Stevens. ""We feel we've done our bit.""
Paul started a campaign group against plans to build up to 4,500 new homes on an area of land just south of Reading. 
group argues the area lacks the infrastructure needed for a major housing development and risks causing flooding and traffic problems. 
""We're potentially tearing up valuable farmland and growth space to fill it with concrete,"" says Andy Bailey, another member of the group. ""It's sacrilege - this should simply not be happening.""
Local campaigners on housebuilding plans: ""It's sacrilege - this should simply not be happening""
University of Reading, which is one of the owners of the land, says: ""We believe we've put forward a good plan that would provide homes, community facilities, and jobs in creative, heritage and high-tech sectors.""
However, a spokesman adds: ""We recognise this is a difficult balancing act, and we welcome discussion about what's best for everyone.""
A spokeswoman for Wokingham Borough Council says draft development plans were prepared by the previous Conservative administration and the council is gathering evidence before setting out the next stages, with no decisions made yet.
Paul does not dispute that there needs to be more affordable housing for young people but says the homes being built in the area are too expensive to solve the problem. 
""My son couldn't afford to live around here. He couldn't afford to buy anywhere,"" he says. 
""These houses are not being built for young people, they're being built for old people who are escaping London.""
Wokingham's Conservative MP John Redwood was among nearly 60 Tories backing a plan to ban mandatory housebuilding targets in England. 
rebels say targets are undermining local decision-making and mean homes aren't built in the right places.
Housing Secretary Michael Gove has now offered councils more flexibility over meeting the government-set targets to ""reflect local circumstances"". 
He told MPs the targets should be ""an advisory starting point"" rather than mandatory. 
rebels have welcomed the change in position, with Mr Redwood saying it will give councils and local communities a role in deciding what is ""sustainable and appropriate"". 
But other Tories have argued weakening targets would mean fewer houses are built, which they say would be politically damaging for the party. 
government says it's still committed to the national target, set out in the 2019 Conservative manifesto, to build 300,000 homes a year in England by the mid-2020s. 
However, it's on track to miss that target, with the figure remaining below 250,000 in recent years. 
Clive Jones, the Liberal Democrat leader of Wokingham Borough Council, says he is ""cautiously optimistic"" above the government's agreement with the rebels but ""the devil is always in the detail"". 
He is hopeful the change will mean local people can decide the level of housing they want in their area. 
Under the current government-calculated targets, Wokingham needs to build around 800 new homes a year up to 2036. 
Mr Jones says this is too many. 
""We have provided 40,000 new homes in the last 40 years and most people will say that is too much. Enough is enough,"" he says. 
""A lot of people have moved here in the last 40 years. They moved here because they like to be in a semi-rural area because that is what Wokingham is.
""It's changing and it's changing too fast for lots of people. It's becoming like a suburb of south London… and that is not what people want.""
Conservatives lost control of the council in May after two decades in charge - although they remain the largest party. 
Lib Dems now run the council in coalition with Labour and Independent councillors. 
Mr Jones says overdevelopment was one of the big issues which contributed to May's local election result. 
He is standing as the Lib Dem candidate for Wokingham in the next general election, which is due in two years' time. 
Mr Jones believes if the current level of development in Wokingham continues it will be a close fight between the Lib Dems and Conservatives, who currently hold the seat with a majority of 7,383. 
""It won't just be housing - it will be the cost-of living-crisis, it will be the crisis in social care,"" he says.
""All of those things coming together are going to make it very difficult for the Conservatives to hold on to this part of Berkshire.""
Even if local targets are made more flexible, Mr Jones says it won't affect developments which have already been approved. 
""[The Conservatives] have forced all of this housing on us over the past 10 years. We have got loads of outstanding planning permissions which will then be built out so there isn't going to suddenly be no more building here.""

politics	Tory MPs urge PM to change law to ease migrant crisis	"More than 50 Tory MPs have urged Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to alter ""quirks"" in modern slavery laws to make it easier to send some migrants home.
r, arranged by former Brexit Secretary David Davis, demands those travelling from ""safe countries"", such as Albania, be returned more quickly.
MPs maintain a ""simple"" change in the law could ease the current crisis. 
A Home Office source said Home Secretary Suella Braverman was ""working flat out"" to solve the issue.
urce said Ms Braverman and Mr Sunak were working ""to bring in reforms to help stem the flow of migrants across the Channel"".
More than 40,000 people have crossed in small boats from France so far this year.
In the letter, Tories describe the crossings as a ""Gordian Knot that needs cutting with a simple policy"".
gnatories argue that a provision in current law prevents the government from returning a person who says they are a victim of modern slavery to their original home.
""If they have really been taken against their will, then they could not reasonably object to being returned to their own homes,"" the letter said.
""The quirks in our modern slavery laws that prevent this are clearly in defiance of the aims of that law and should be removed.""
MPs, including former cabinet ministers Dr Liam Fox and Esther McVey, and veteran backbenchers Sir Peter Bottomley and Sir Graham Brady, are among the 50-strong body of Conservative politicians calling for the change.
rgue this ""straightforward and legally workable way of addressing the crisis"" would be a ""very strong deterrent"" to those who might be planning to make the trip across the Channel.
Mr Davis said the number of people from safe countries like Albania claiming asylum in the UK was ""paralysing the whole system"". 
""I want to protect the asylum system for people who really need it,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 
rge majority of migrants claim asylum on arrival in the UK and many are housed in hotels while awaiting the outcome of their applications, which are often subject to delay.
Speaking last week, Ms Braverman admitted the UK government has failed to control its borders, blaming migrants and people smugglers for recent chaos at Kent's Manston processing centre.
usands of migrants were placed in tents at the centre during the autumn months, leading to overcrowding and outbreaks of disease. 
Everyone staying at the temporary site has since been placed in alternative accommodation, according to the Home Office.
Last month, MPs from the Home Affairs Committee heard how the UK was spending about £7m a day on hotels to house asylum seekers.
A government spokeswoman said: ""We have made clear that there is no one single solution to stop the increase in dangerous crossings.
""We have also made clear that we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to deter illegal migration.
""We are expediting the removal of individuals by agreeing tailored bilateral returns agreements with partners like Albania, elevating it to a key priority for our foreign policy."""
politics	Is cost of living causing children to miss school in Wales?	"re are calls for an urgent government investigation into children missing school due to the cost of living crisis.
One in five pupils from poorer backgrounds were persistently absent last year, official figures show.
A Senedd report says there needs to be more understanding of the problems facing families, such as travel, uniform, and school trip costs.
Welsh government said improving attendance is a ""national priority"".
Persistent absence is when a pupil misses more than 20% of classes over the school year.
report, following an inquiry by the Children, Young People and Education Committee, said it had received evidence that school closures during the pandemic led to a ""more accepting attitude to lower school attendance"", and suggested a public campaign is needed to help reverse the trend.
Figures for October this year highlight a difference for pupils eligible for free school meals.
Attendance for those who can get free meals is at 86.9%, while those who do not qualify have a better attendance at 93.1%. 
Children's Commissioner for Wales Rocio Cifuentes told the inquiry attendance figures were also ""significantly lower"" for children in year groups not entitled to free travel and that tackling child poverty should be a ""key driver in reducing absence"".
Jayne Bryant, the committee's Labour chairwoman, said sending children to school was an ""expensive business"".
""Parents have to find money for uniforms, books, technology, stationery, school bags, school trips, after school clubs,"" she said. 
""The lack of free transport is also an issue for many - in a cost of living crisis with rising inflation, this is getting even harder every day.
""Today, we're calling on the Welsh government to get to the bottom of how rising costs are impacting pupil attendance and to start campaigns nationwide and locally reinforcing the importance of school attendance.""
As Covid hit education, ministers discouraged councils from fining parents for not ensuring children go to school.
But in May, amid worries about attendances, councils were asked to go back to pre-pandemic guidance.
Education Minister Jeremy Miles emphasised fines should be a ""last-resort"" and would only be used in the most extreme cases.
Responding to the report, Mr Miles said several steps had been taken to support families and schools, including £4m for family engagement officers to work with families and pupils.
""This year we also provided £24m which was focused on learners in exam years, including dedicated funding for an attendance officer in each local authority to support learners,"" he added."
politics	Income tax hike for high earners backed by Plaid Cymru	"Major income tax rises for high earners have been backed by Plaid Cymru politicians, BBC Wales has learned.
A majority of its Members of the Senedd (MS) voted for a 4p in the pound increase for people earning more than £50,000 and a 5p hike for those bringing in more than £150,000.
But the idea has not been formally announced and it is not clear why.
A Plaid spokeswoman said the party would explore how changing taxes could look in practice ""over coming weeks"".
was to be presented as a ""solidarity tax"" to help fund public services during the cost of living crisis.
Plaid Cymru is not in government but supports Welsh Labour ministers through the co-operation agreement.
Welsh government has had some income tax powers since 2019, but has never used them.
Ministers can adjust the basic rate, higher rate and additional rate by 10p in every £1, but do not have powers over the thresholds at which people pay the different rates.
Minutes of a meeting of Plaid Cymru's group in the Senedd held in October said seven MSs voted for raising taxes for those earning more than £50,271 in order to fund public services, with three voting against.
minutes said: ""This can be presented as short-term solidarity tax, for specific purposes.
""Some members felt the need to consider the implications of doing this further, and the potential unfairness of raising the higher and extra tax to the same extent.""
In 2023-24, a 4p increase in the higher rate of income tax would raise an estimated £132m and a 5p increase in the additional rate would raise an extra £25m. 
roposal was supported before Plaid Cymru's annual conference, where party leader Adam Price talked generally about the prospect of a ""solidarity tax"" and argued Wales' income tax powers should be ""used progressively to shield the vulnerable and protect our public services"".
But in an interview with the BBC Politics Wales programme on the weekend of Plaid Cymru's conference, he declined to say by how much Plaid would raise income taxes.
He said it would only be possible to ""set out that detail"" following the UK government's Autumn Statement, which was delivered on 17 November.
On 18 October, Mr Price raised the idea of a ""solidarity tax"" in the Senedd and called on First Minister Mark Drakeford to consider raising the top two rates of income tax to ""help us relieve some of the pressure on local services"".
Mr Drakeford said was ""no chance"" the tax rises would cover the costs outlined, describing the idea as ""pie in the sky"". 
A party spokeswoman said: ""Plaid Cymru remain focused on what matters - supporting the most vulnerable in our communities through one of the hardest winters we have faced.
""We look forward to exploring how this could look in practice over the coming weeks by scrutinising the Welsh government budget and engaging with external expert organisations including the Wales Governance Centre.""
Welsh government's draft budget for 2023-24 is due to be published on 13 December."
politics	More Holyrood taxes come at a cost	"re are benefits from putting up taxes, but none of them cost-free. On the upside, John Swinney is raising £129m next year, mainly from higher earners. 
Also on the upside, the Scottish Parliament is moving beyond the experimental phase of fiddling with its new tax powers. Budget day used to be all about how to spend money. This year's budget is at least as much about how to secure the tax revenue necessary.
makes for a more balanced and mature politics than we used to see.
Finding another £129m is not that much in a budget of £45bn, and a long way behind the £918m set to be raised from the effects of inflation. But the way it is funded adds to a developing trend of divergence from the UK's income tax regime.
Scottish Fiscal Commission tells us that the tax take next year is set to be £1bn more than it would have been without devolution of income tax. That is on course to rise above £1.5bn within five years.
A lot of the increase comes from freezing thresholds for different rates of tax. While earners seek pay increases to meet at least some of their additional costs due to inflation, the tax on that delivers more money into the Scottish government kitty. And as more people move into the higher tax bands, a lot more revenue is raised. That is known as fiscal drag or a stealth tax.
ke a look at individual earner level: for those earning above £43,662, each additional pound earned has 42p deducted in Scotland. In the rest of the UK, that deduction is 20p, and so it continues up to £50,270 where the marginal tax rate rises to 40p. 
Also, over that tranche of earnings, National Insurance Contributions, which are linked to rest-of-the-UK thresholds, continue to be deducted at 12p in the pound, before falling to 2p. So the combined deduction from each pound earned at that level in Scotland is 54p, and 32p elsewhere.
So if your earnings are at that higher rate threshold just below £44,000, you are £158 worse off in tax take in Scotland compared with the rest of the UK. If your pay goes up to £50,000, that gap with Westminster will have gone up to £1,558.  For a GP on £100,000 a year, the Scottish income tax bill tops £30,000, and is £2,606 more than it would be for the same earnings in England or Wales.
How many are caught in that wider net of higher tax? The SFC estimates a rise from 11.6% of taxpayers in 2016 to 18.4% next year - nearly one in five. That is no longer an earnings elite.
Looked at another way, by only slightly increasing the threshold for higher rate tax in Scotland since 2016, there has been a 23% growth in the numbers paying it, while raising the threshold in the rest of the UK has led to a drop of 10%.
It goes on to say that the newly announced change in policy would raise an extra £128m, but only if no-one changed their tax arrangements to avoid it - for instance, by taking income as dividends, which are taxed by the UK Treasury. Once ""behavioural effects"" kick in, then SFC estimates revenue falls from £128m to £92m.
re's a more pronounced effect for those earning above £125,000. They face a move from 41p in each extra pound to 47p. The SFC says the change of threshold should bring in £33m if no-one's tax affairs were changed. But once they are, that revenue falls to only £8m.
Raising the tax paid by these highest earners would raise £33m next year, but it's forecast to bring in only £3m.
At the basic level of tax, the effect of fiscal drag is much lower. As people move past its £14,332 lower threshold, the amount of tax paid is expected to rise £20m.  There will be a smaller behavioural change, some of it from people working fewer hours, and the forecast is down only £1m to £19m.
Divergence should come as no surprise.  However the income tax powers were used after being devolved, the point was to use them differently, or perhaps to make a positive choice to leave them unchanged.
In the five years since income tax was devolved, Scottish government ministers began by re-shaping income tax into five strands instead of three, one of which means that the lower paid people are £20 better off in Scotland than they would be in the rest of the UK. That helps make a political point, but makes little difference to public finances.
majority remain no worse off than they would be south of the border on the same pay, but the changes were calibrated to ensure that above-average full time earnings in Scotland come with higher tax bills. In 2023-24, the point at which earners in Scotland start to pay more tax than the person earning the same salary elsewhere is £27,850. 
rogressive, in that the higher burden falls on those who are best equipped to pay. And it helps pay for more generous public services.  
At least in the free provision of student tuition, dental and eye checks, and more generous long-term care packages, there are obvious pay-backs from paying higher tax. 
An uplift in the quality of service is more debatable, as Scotland has long had more inputs per head into schools and the health service.
What is changing fastest in the Scottish budget is the amount going into social security benefits. These are being gradually devolved. Cold weather payments are the latest to move to Holyrood, meaning a £50 flat fee per winter, rather than qualifying through temperature drops over a sustained period.
xpected to cost more than twice as much as it did before. With the intention of prioritising dignity and fairness in allocating welfare payments, and with entirely new benefits being created, such as the Scottish Child Payment, it is a more generous system. 
reasury provides Holyrood with the funds that would have been allocated to Scots if none of this budget were devolved.
SFC reckons that the Scottish government is having to raid other budgets this year for £400m to have a more generous system, rising to £800m next year, and to £1.4bn within five years.
It is, emphasises John Swinney, about choices. Some choices were forced on him: to delay delivery of government projects, though he did little to spell out which ones: a choice not to set a pay policy for next financial year, when it could inflame the unresolved disputes over pay in the current year.
made on tax come with downsides or at least risks.
One is that raising tax in a recession sucks money out of consumer spending and hurts business revenue and economic growth.
A counter-argument to that is that the same pounds put into the pay of a public sector worker or someone on benefits may be more likely to be spent in the economy. If it is a direct transfer, it can be efficient. Lots of other government spending may be less so.
r risk is that these 'behavioural effects' become more significant. We don't know the point at which people decide that Scotland's taxes are too high and they choose to leave, because every such decision is different, and often influenced by other factors.
Even at a high salary of £100,000, the gap between tax paid in Scotland and the bill in England is unlikely, on its own, to make it worthwhile for someone to sell their home and move out of Scotland.
But there is a perception issue for a country that aspires to attract people in, to fill vacancies in its health service, to work in senior positions at its universities, to start up businesses, or to build up tech companies with high-earning employees.
't have to make a calculation of how much higher tax might be. A perception of a country that levies higher tax, and is on a course of continuing to diverge in that direction, while not having much growth, may be a less attractive one for an internationally mobile high-value worker. 
Or it may have the makings of a 'social contract' - one of John Swinney's favourite phrases on budget day - which potential immigrants find attractive.
Either way, both the UK and Scotland seem to be on a journey towards resolving the tensions of wanting Scandinavian level services with American-level tax. 
Conservatives at Westminster are offering a big state for now, though some hanker for a much smaller one.
Scotland is moving faster towards the Scandi choice. But it will require a much more efficiently productive economy, breaking out of chronic low growth that will deliver on that vision. 
SFC report on the state of the economy was grim: unemployment forecast to rise to 4.7%, though from a low base, now at 3.3%; house prices falling by more than 5% and not fully recovering over five years; a recession through next year, which doesn't look as bad as the Bank of England forecast. 
And while it may be shallow, recovery is forecast to be weak - recovering to pre-recession output at the start of 2025, and not getting back to pre-Covid levels of late 2019 until the third quarter of 2025.
By 2026, when growth might reach 2%, the SFC indicates that we may be facing a new challenge of deflating prices.
After last decade's exceptionally weak recovery from the financial crash, this decade looks grim as well, in growth of the economy, and in an unprecedented fall in disposable household income. 
Without faster growth, meeting high expectations of public services will require higher and higher levels of tax."

politics	Farming: Delay to post-EU subsidy scheme Elms not acceptable say farmers	"m Bradshaw said ""uncertainty is crippling businesses""
Farmers have called on the government to clarify what post-EU support they will receive to improve the environment, six years after the Brexit vote.
Cambridgeshire famer Martin Lines said he felt ""let down"" by government delay.
After the UK left the EU, instead of European subsidies a replacement scheme was proposed for farmers, but this has been put back.
government said it was right to review the scheme.
On Thursday, new Environment Secretary and Suffolk Coastal MP Therese Coffey confirmed that the review of the Environmental Land Management Scheme (Elms) was complete and further clarity on the scheme would be announced early in the new year.
Elms payments, which cover England, will replace the EU scheme for agriculture where subsidies were mostly on the basis of the amount of land farmed.
Alongside payments for sustainable farming practices such as managing soils, Elms was designed to pay for ""local nature recovery"" habitat creation on farms and ""landscape recovery"" projects to restore nature at a large scale, including rewilding schemes.
In her speech at the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) conference, Ms Coffey said: ""I am committed to giving you the clarity, certainty and support that I know you need, so early in the new year - I can't make the announcements today - we will be saying more about what we'll be offering to pay you to do in the next phase of all the schemes.""
Martin Lines, who farms about 900 acres (364 hectares) near St Neots in Cambridgeshire, said: ""Moving to a scheme that rewards positive action I've been really supportive of and quite vocally supportive of.
""But I feel quite let down by the government for the lack of information and clarity to help the whole farm industry transition to something better.""
Mr Lines, who is part of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, added: ""They [the government] should get a move on and give us some clarity, give us some real certainty and ambition within the schemes to get to where we all need to get to in the next 10 years.""
Essex farmer Tom Bradshaw, who is also deputy president of the National Farmers' Union, said: ""The latest delay is simply not acceptable. We've had six years to get to this point and we're still kicking the can down the road.
""Members' payments have been reduced and we were always told they would not be reduced until there was another scheme in place.""
Farming minister Mark Spencer told BBC Politics East: ""I think it is quite reasonable to make sure that the schemes we are going to roll out help us as a nation deliver on our carbon commitments and make sure we are improving the environment, improving our biodiversity.
""I think it is reasonable to say when a new secretary of state comes in, she has to have a window of opportunity just to review and make sure that the schemes are going to deliver these outcomes, as we want this to work.""

politics	NI Protocol: Paramilitaries probably involved in protests, says PSNI	"Loyalist paramilitaries probably played a role in organising protest rallies against the Northern Ireland Protocol this year, a police commander has said.
Assistant Chief Constable Mark McEwan said the individuals were part of locally-formed ""coalitions"".
He was responding to questions from South Belfast MP Claire Hanna during a Westminster committee hearing.
Northern Ireland Affairs Committee is taking evidence about the effects paramilitaries are having on society.
Ms Hanna of the SDLP asked him: ""Obviously organising a rally is not a crime but are you aware of any individuals linked to paramilitary organisations who were involved in organising events billed as peaceful protests?""
Mr McEwan responded: ""They were generally organised by what were formed as coalitions.
""There may be members of those coalitions who have links to paramilitary groups, absolutely.
""But that is not to say that the coalitions themselves are controlled by paramilitary groups or otherwise.""
Dozens of peaceful protests were held to express unionist and loyalist opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol, particularly in the run-up to last May's Stormont assembly election.
None have taken place since the summer.
rotocol is the post-Brexit trading arrangement for Northern Ireland, which was agreed between the UK and the EU.
Special arrangements had to be put in place for Northern Ireland after Brexit because it had an EU land border with the Republic of Ireland.
rotocol allows goods to be transported across that border without the need for checks at that point.
Instead the goods are inspected whenever they arrive in Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK.
But unionist political parties argue that the protocol has undermined Northern Ireland's place within the UK by effectively creating a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Unionist politicians such as Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister frequently addressed the protest rallies against the protocol.
Mr McEwan also told the committee that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) does not negotiate with paramilitary figures who act as ""gatekeepers"" in some communities.
Alliance Party MP Stephen Farry said: ""I once remember a new (police) commander coming in to an area and the first photograph which appeared in the local paper was him shaking the hand of the person who was widely known to be a leading paramilitary.
""That type of thing sends out a signal that those are the type of people the police are talking to.
""To be fair this is an issue across the public sector,"" said the North Down politician.
Mr McEwan replied: ""I can't speak to the individual incident.
""Where people who have had former paramilitary connections are involved in constitutionally-formed groups, we do engage with them.
""They are often supported through various levels of government.""
He went on to stress that the police take ""robust"" action against paramilitaries across the spectrum.
""We are fearless in how we go about pursuing them.
""The complexities of a post-conflict society in no way waiver us from our relentless pursuit of criminality."""
politics	Liberal Democrats eye blue wall seats in wake of Tory turmoil	"It can be hard for the Liberal Democrats to make themselves heard at the best of times, but recently the party has been particularly unlucky. 
For two years running the Lib Dems have been unable to gather in person for their annual conference, while other parties' events went ahead - robbing them of a guaranteed moment in the media spotlight. 
ftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 and the death of the Queen this year left them with little choice but to cancel the biggest event in their calendar. 
weekend, party leader Sir Ed Davey is touring Lib Dem target seats and will make a speech in London in an attempt to renew his offer to voters. 
But languishing a distant third in opinion polls and with only 14 MPs, where does the party sit after months of political turmoil at Westminster?
Party insiders point to a run of by-election wins and bold policy pitches as proof the Lib Dems are able to punch above their political weight. 
A surprise victory in the Conservative seat of Chesham and Amersham in June 2021 was followed by wins in other Tory strongholds - North Shropshire later that year and Tiverton and Honiton in June. 
Liberal Democrats hope to replicate this across the so-called 'blue wall' of Conservative-held seats with more affluent and higher educated populations that voted largely to remain in the EU. 
f the list is Wimbledon, where the party lost by just 628 votes in 2019. The Lib Dems report plenty of anti-Conservative sentiment on the doorstep in the leafy south London enclave which returned a Labour MP in 1997 but has been held by the Tories since 2005.
One campaigner was told by a life-long Conservative voter they regretted supporting the party in 2019 and were ""ready for change"", summing up similar sentiment from others.
But conscious of becoming pigeon-holed as a political refuge for liberal Conservative voters fed up with the direction under Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and now Rishi Sunak, the Lib Dems are keen to stress their electoral ambitions extend beyond the south of England. 
In Greater Manchester, for example, the party is looking to build on second place finishes in 2019 in Cheadle and Hazel Grove, where it recently took control of Stockport Borough Council in this year's local elections. 
Sir Ed Davey celebrates his party's win in the Chesham and Amersham while breaking down a model blue wall
Common among the party's target seats is a high proportion of home ownership, leaving voters in these areas exposed to the impact of recent interest rate rises. 
Recent polling conducted on the party's behalf suggested a majority of Conservative voters blamed the government for rising mortgages, compounding the Lib Dems' message that the blue wall is being ""hit hardest"" by the knock-on effects of an increase in interest rates. 
In the aftermath of the tax-cutting mini-budget delivered by Kwasi Kwarteng in September, a  poll found two thirds (68%) of people who had voted Conservatives in 2019 said the government would be to blame if mortgage bills subsequently increased. 
f 2,240 adults aged 18+ was conducted by Savanta ComRes between 30 September and 2 October.
Sir Ed Davey is expected to make a call for homeowners struggling to pay their mortgage to be better protected in a speech to party activists in London on Sunday. 
Lib Dems hope the move will influence the political debate around an issue facing millions of voters in a similar way to the party's calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and an energy price freeze this winter. 
Similarly, the party hopes to capitalise on a sense of frustration among voters that key public services are ""broken"", as one senior party figure put it, with their call for guaranteed GP appointments within a week in England. 
Eye-catching policies may gain the Lib Dems some attention and allow them to punch above their political weight, but their prospects at the next election may have as much if not more to do with the fortunes of their opponents as it does their own offering. 
Senior Lib Dems considered the Conservatives to be vulnerable on the economy while Boris Johnson was prime minister and sought to ""hammer home"" the impact of the rising cost of living. 
urmoil that marked Liz Truss's time in No 10 may have fuelled their attacks on government incompetence, but will the same tactics work against the new man in charge?
Lib Dems claim not to be fazed by Rishi Sunak as prime minister, citing what they see as his slowness to act as chancellor on the cost of living crisis and controversy around Suella Braverman's re-appointment as home secretary as potential weak points. 
Labour's lead in opinion polls has widened as popularity plummeted for the Conservatives, but the Lib Dems' standing has remained largely stagnant. 
Some in the party argue that anti-Conservative sentiment can only be a good thing for the Lib Dems and increase the party's chances of unseating Tory MPs at the next election. 
Furthermore, insiders claim Labour's apparent popularity among voters helps the party too, removing the 2019 ""fear factor"" of a Jeremy Corbyn government which may have prevented some Conservative voters switching to the Lib Dems in blue wall seats. 
Sir John Curtice, president of the British Polling Council, said the Liberal Democrats would ""probably pick up Labour voters in places where they're second"".
But he added that the economy was ""never ever their strong point"" and voters may struggle to identify the party's position on major issues. 
""I'm just not sure enough people know what the hell they stand for,"" Sir John said. 
may not worry the Lib Dems as much as it might. 
At the 2019 general election the then party leader Jo Swinson touted herself as the UK's next prime minister and talked of winning ""hundreds of seats"". 
Her successor is unlikely to make a similar pitch, instead seeking to make the most of hostility towards the Conservatives and argue that electing Liberal Democrat MPs in seats where Labour is unlikely to win is the only way to remove them from government. "
politics	Deaths in Scottish prisons at record high	"Stuart Allan says the impact of the death of daughter Katie in prison has been massive
A record number of people have died in Scottish prisons in the past three years.
A report, by academics at Glasgow University, shows there have been 121 deaths since the start of 2020, with suicide and drugs deaths on the rise.
rate of suicide and drugs deaths in Scottish jails is significantly higher than in England, the report said. 
Scottish Prison Service said it worked to give people the best possible care and wellbeing. 
w report, seen by the BBC, studied data going back to 1995.
It said the 121 people who died in prison in Scotland between the start of 2020 and September this year compared with 98 in the previous three full years.
Covid played a role in the record-breaking number of prison deaths, with 15 prisoners dying from the virus, but deaths from other medical conditions have held fairly steady while drugs fatalities and people taking their own lives have been on the rise.
re have been 29 deaths by suicide and 25 from drugs since the start of 2020, with a further eight whose cause is undetermined, which could add to the drugs toll.
mics said deaths from suicide and drugs were typically ""from distress and loss of hope"", which are of particular concern when assessing prison regimes and conditions
report said a person who was imprisoned in 2022 in Scotland would be twice as likely to die in jail as someone in 2008.
Prof Sarah Armstrong, one of the lead authors of the report, said: ""We don't have a death penalty anymore in this country and yet for many people - more than 100 - going to prison is a death sentence. 
""We are talking about people who are entirely dependent on the state to live. 
""People in prison won't get food, won't get healthcare or shelter unless the state does its job. 
""And when you have such a high rate of death in prison - and a higher suicide rate and drug death rate than in English prisons - real questions are raised about the quality of that care.""
rison service introduced its suicide prevention strategy called Talk To Me six years ago.
mics found that there had been a 42% increase in suicides since the strategy was introduced compared with the six previous years.
Katie Allan was a third year student at Glasgow University when she was jailed for a hit and run incident. She was just 21 when she took her own life in Polmont in 2018. 
Her mother Linda Allan, who is an academic and co-author of the report, said: ""People in prison are being failed by the state and losing their lives in the care of the state. And very often - in our opinion - that is avoidable."" 
Katie's father Stuart said there had been more than 50 suicides in Scottish jails since his daughter died. 
""The impact on us has been massive,"" he said. 
""You don't go a day or a moment in the day without thinking about Katie."" 
Mr Allan said he lived his life battling to get a justification for why Katie died and to make sure it did not happen to other people who found themselves in the prison service.
Fatal Accident Inquiries (FAIs) are meant to ensure an effective investigation into deaths and accountability but the report said they were failing to do that. 
It found that, on average, FAIs into prison deaths took more than two years to complete and almost never made any recommendations or offered points of learning for the prison service. 
One inquiry published earlier this year took more than four years and made no findings beyond time, place and cause of death. 
report highlighted cases where prisoners died arguably preventable deaths, including one man who died from psoriasis after waiting months for medical treatment. 
It also highlighted inmates who took their own lives after not being placed on suicide watch despite a history of self-harm. 
report said: ""One year has passed since we reported that deaths have been rising in Scottish prisons, and that FAIs to investigate these take a significant amount of time only to determine no changes are needed. 
""Since then, deaths have continued to rise, accelerating during the pandemic for reasons beyond Covid, and FAIs are continuing to take years with the same low rate of determining nothing could be done, or can be done.""
Scottish government-commissioned Independent Review of the Response to Deaths in Custody, published 12 months ago, emphasised ""the human rights obligation of the state to carry out an effective investigation into death and ensure accountability where state responsibility arises"".
Scottish government accepted the recommendation and set up a deaths in custody action group - but since then the rate of deaths has increased. 
A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said: ""We recognise the profound emotional distress experienced by families when a loved one dies in custody.""
He said the prison service wanted people to have the best possible health and wellbeing and was working closely with the NHS and charities on suicide prevention.
Earlier this year, the prison service said the most common way to smuggle psychoactive substances into jails was by spraying them on to pieces of paper posted to prisoners.
SPS spokesman said preventative measures such as photocopying mail had led to a significant fall in illicit substance misuse.
He also said that there are increasing numbers of older people in prison, with the same health and care challenges as the wider community.
A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The safe treatment and mental health of all those in custody is a key priority for Scotland's prisons, which care for people with higher levels of risk and vulnerability than the general population as a whole.
""The Crown Office has significantly reformed its processes to reduce the time taken to investigate deaths and to bring FAIs to court more quickly. It is for the presiding sheriff, who has heard all the evidence, to determine what recommendations, if any, should be made."""
politics	Tory MP Andrew Bridgen facing suspension from Commons	"Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen is facing a Commons suspension after breaching lobbying rules ""on multiple occasions and in multiple ways"".
ross-party Standards Committee found he had displayed a ""very cavalier"" attitude to the rules. 
It called for him to be suspended for a total of five sitting days for offences including an ""unacceptable attack upon the integrity"" of Standards Commissioner Kathryn Stone.  
whole House will vote on sanctions. 
In a statement, the North West Leicestershire MP said he was ""extremely disappointed"", but accepted the committee's findings and would ""comply with them as required to do so"", 
mmittee said Mr Bridgen had called the integrity of Ms Stone into question on the basis of ""wholly unsubstantiated and false allegations, and attempted to improperly influence the House's standards processes"".  
It recommended a suspension of three days for this - in addition to two days for for three breaches of the MPs' code of conduct, including failing to declare a relevant interest in emails to ministers.
report found Mr Bridgen had ""demonstrated a very cavalier attitude to the House's rules on registration and declaration of interests, including repeatedly saying that he did not check his own entry in the register"". 
mmittee said Mr Bridgen should have told ministers and officials he received a donation and a funded visit to Ghana from the Cheshire-based firm Mere Plantations, and had a £12,000 contract to be an adviser.  
He was found to have committed a ""significant litany of errors"" by failing to do so in eight emails to ministers, and in five meetings with ministers or public officials, as he discussed Mere's tax treatment and trading of carbon credits. 
MP had questioned whether his reputation as an outspoken critic of then-prime minister Boris Johnson could have influenced Ms Stone's findings.
He wrote to her saying: ""I was distressed to hear on a number of occasions an unsubstantiated rumour that your contract as Parliamentary Standards Commissioner is due to end in the coming months and that there are advanced plans to offer you a peerage, potentially as soon as the Prime Minister's resignation honours list.
""There is also some suggestion amongst colleagues that those plans are dependent upon arriving at the 'right' outcomes when conducting parliamentary standards investigations.
""Clearly my own travails with Number 10 and the former PM have been well documented and obviously a small part of me is naturally concerned to hear such rumours.
""More importantly however you are rightfully renowned for your integrity and decency and no doubt such rumours are only designed to harm your reputation.""
mmittee said Mr Bridgen's email ""appears to be an attempt to place wholly inappropriate pressure on the commissioner"" which is ""completely unacceptable behaviour"".
Commons will vote on whether to approve the recommended five days' suspension. 
Mr Bridgen must also apologise to the House and the commissioner. But he will not face a recall petition from his constituents - that could have triggered a by-election - because the period of suspension falls short of the 10 sitting days required. 
His trip in August 2019 to a plantation funded by Mere, which grows mainly teak in the Ashanti region of Ghana while focusing on the reforestation of degraded land, was valued at £3,251.51.
Mr Bridgen argued during the investigation that the lobbying rules did not apply because the trip was of ""negative financial benefit"" to him.
He said he was left ""personally out of pocket"" because he paid for his own yellow fever vaccination and bought local currency which he could not convert to pounds once back in the UK.
""This local currency I gave away to a Ghanaian doorkeeper in Parliament as I would not be visiting again,"" he told the committee.
Mere also donated £5,000 to Mr Bridgen's local Conservative association in October 2019.
His correspondence with ministers included emails to Kwasi Kwarteng when he was business secretary in February 2021 and then-financial secretary to the Treasury Jesse Norman in August 2021. 
Mr Bridgen argued he did not need to declare interests when ""acting as a constituency MP"", but the committee ruled that this exemption ""cannot be considered as a blank cheque"" and that his activities extended beyond the initial constituency focus.
Ms Stone - who is independent - found that the MP ""habitually failed to declare his interests with Mere Plantations"".  
Labour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the case was ""just another example of the lack of ethics and integrity at the heart of the Conservative Party"". "

politics	Hythe Tory councillor resigns over far-right links	"A Tory councillor has quit after fresh evidence emerged over his links to a far-right organisation.
Andy Weatherhead had already been suspended by his local party in Kent after it emerged he used to be a member of the New British Union (NBU).
Hythe West councillor now says he is stepping down as a member on Kent County Council (KCC).
It comes as the BBC uncovered an interview in 2014 which apparently shows the extent of his NBU links.
Mr Weatherhead confirmed he gave the interview, but denied he was NBU policy officer, the term used by the interviewer to introduce him.
He gave the interview to an online radio station called the American Nationalist Network under the pseudonym Andrew Blackhouse.
In the recording, he is heard saying: ""I've always been an admirer of fascism. I've always been an admirer of Benito Mussolini and Sir Oswald Mosley, and last year I was trawling through the internet as one does and came across the New British Union and I thought 'hello, this sounds like right up my street', so I contacted them.""
He also refers to his work for the NBU as ""fleshing out policies"".
Mr Weatherhead apologised in a statement given to the BBC and said: ""It was not my intent to cause harm or offend. It is in the past. I completely and utterly reject anything to do with fascism.""
He said he had not heard from or seen NBU leader Gary Raikes since 2014.
He also claimed that when he had talked about ""fleshing out policies"" in the interview, this meant ""adding punctuation"".
Mr Weatherhead said the policies themselves had been written by the British Union in the 1930s.
Last week, after he was suspended by Folkestone and Hythe Conservatives, he said the NBU had not been a registered political party, had no defined membership and his links with the group were ""in the spirit of education and curiosity"".
He said after 2014 he had re-entered mainstream politics and turned his back on fringe politics ""having seen it for what it truly was"".
r of KCC, Roger Gough, said he welcomed Andy Weatherhead's resignation as a councillor.
He said: ""The views and associations reported have no place in the Kent County Council Conservative group.""

He has been suspended as a Conservative MP since announcing he was off to Australia. One Tory colleague described him as an ""absolute prat"" and he has faced calls from opposition politicians to give up his MP's salary, £84,144 a year.
He was appointed health secretary in 2018, before overseeing pandemic restrictions including lockdowns and social distancing.
footage, which showed him breaking his own social distancing rules with his political aide and university friend Gina Coladangelo, was leaked to the Sun. 
Dominic Cummings, who was Boris Johnson's closest advisor, claimed Mr Hancock had lied about Covid testing hospital patients before they were released into care homes. This was firmly denied by Mr Hancock. Mr Cummings also published expletive-laden messages about a different issue, purportedly from Boris Johnson, in which the PM calls the health secretary ""hopeless"".
Born and raised in Cheshire, he studied philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University and then economics at Cambridge. Before becoming MP for West Suffolk he worked for his family's computer software business and as an economist for the Bank of England. He has three children.
He's said he hopes to use his time in the jungle to raise awareness about the learning difficulty that affects reading and writing. 
In 2012, he won a charity horse race after training for three months, losing two stone in the process. Nicknamed ""Action Matt"" by the press, photos of him running, swimming and jumping over small fences often appear in the newspapers."
sports	Georgina Roberts: Shooting's absence from Commonwealth Games 'a real blow'	"Welsh trap shooter Georgina Roberts is hoping to put her Commonwealth Games disappointment behind her at the first ISSF World Cup event of the year.
Roberts fulfilled selection criteria, but the 2022 Games in Birmingham will be without shooting for the first time since 1970 in Edinburgh.
24-year-old instead now travels to Cyprus to try the new World Cup format.
""Birmingham 2022 would have been my first Games and shooting not being involved was a real blow,"" she said.
""It would have been at a range we've been training at so the chances for myself and other teammates medalling would have been incredibly high.
""It's such a shame to have wasted that opportunity.""
India had originally threatened to boycott the Games if shooting wasn't included - even offering to host the shooting and archery competitions themselves - before abandoning the plan due to Covid-19 in July 2021.

""This year is now about ramping up to Paris 2024 [Olympics],"" said Roberts.
""We've got to work towards getting a place for that and then focus on the ultimate goal, an Olympic gold medal.
""All we can do is be positive for the future, keep working towards how we can champion our sport so next time we're likely to be back at the Commonwealth Games.""
Roberts' first competition win was in Malaga back in January 2020, and Roberts is keen to get back on track with her lofty ambitions.
""I'm a very optimistic and ambitious person,"" she added.
""Olympic gold is my dream and if I could do it in Paris I'd be the happiest person in the world.
""I think the thing I love about our sport is longevity, there's no age limit you can continue to go and medal at the Olympics, some have gone into their 50s.
""I want a final, I want a medal and I want a gold in Paris, but it's the getting there the really hard part.

sports	URC: Edinburgh 25-32 Glasgow Warriors - Horne stars as visitors win 1872 Cup	"Glasgow Warriors beat Edinburgh 32-25 to secure a second United Rugby Championship win over their Scottish rivals and the 1872 Cup.
Emiliano Boffelli kicked the hosts into an eight-point lead at the break after two tries for each team, Jamie Ritchie and Luke Crosbie for Edinburgh and Kyle Steyn and Matt Fagerson for Glasgow.
m Jordan's converted try and 13 points from George Horne put Warriors back in front and ensured them a bonus point, Patrick Harrison replying for Edinburgh.
Warriors, who won 16-10 last Friday, move up a place to fifth in the league.
Edinburgh were so passive for so long in round one at Scotstoun that there was only way for them to go in round two. After three losses in a row in the URC they desperately needed a victory to get themselves back up the table.
It did not start well for them and it finished nightmarishly but in between they had good moments and a handsome lead before their demons swooped and destroyed them.
Having come into this full of fire and brimstone they shipped an early try. Sione Tuipulotu was immense all night, even when Glasgow toiled for the first 40.
re gave the visitors good field position with a big line break. Glasgow worked it right, then left, Steyn's footwork proving too much for a flimsy Edinburgh defence. Jordan's conversion made it 7-0 and Mike Blair's team were back in bother.
r discomfort did not last long. They found an aggression and a control that garnered 17 points without reply. Home-free? One might have thought so.
Glasgow were not at the races in that period. Edinburgh got their first try after Ali Price was charged down while attempting a box kick in his own 22. His team-mates were sluggish in trying to claim the loose ball and when the hosts jumped on it, Ritchie soon ploughed over. Boffelli, inevitably, fired over the conversion.
Argentine added a penalty to make it 10-7, The gap would have been wider had Sebastian Cancelliere not done wonderfully well to get under Duhan van der Merwe over the try line.
r pressure did tell in the end, though. Glasgow, as passive in the first half here as they were steely last week, could not defend a driven lineout, Crosbie crashing over with Boffelli landing a beauty of a conversion from out wide. The crowd of more than 25,000 were lapping it up.
re was an occasional sign of life from Glasgow, normally provided by the dump truck Tuipulotu. Another surge, where Edinburgh bounced off him as if he was a human wall, took Glasgow downfield and they stayed there until Fagerson scored from a smart play off a lineout.
Boffelli put over a penalty just before the break. Edinburgh should have been further ahead and, given their history this season, eight points was a precarious advantage.
Blair's side have had a wretched habit of coughing up decent leads and the ghost of defeats revisited them when Glasgow suddenly got a foothold.
Just before the hour they scored their third try from not far off their third proper attack. It was a pearler. Richie Gray, Sione Vailanu and Cancelliere combined at pace down the right. The wing then put in Jordan for the score, the fly-half then landing the conversion to make it 20-19.
Glasgow now had the bit between their teeth, the momentum completely shifting in their favour. They hit the lead with 13 minutes left with a Horne penalty, given away by Marshall Sykes under his own posts. Sykes was yellow carded for good measure.
Another Edinburgh collapse? Not half. Just as they were gathering their senses having fallen behind, they conceded again. Again it was the outstanding Tuipulotu in the thick of it. His grubber was seized on by Steyn, who gathered, ran on and fed his support runner. Horne took the key pass from Jordan and ran away to score. A ruthless finish from a player who had a seismic influence when he replaced Price.
Edinburgh were stunned. Horne added another penalty to bring his own haul to 13 points in seven spectacular minutes. From there, they never looked like showing the weakness in their game that Edinburgh showed in theirs. Harrison sneaked over on the right to give Edinburgh some comfort.
re hugely encouraging days for Franco Smith's side and enormously worrying times for Edinburgh, who are now on a grim run of four URC losses in a row.
Edinburgh head coach Mike Blair: ""It was really disappointing to see what happened in the second half. Glasgow got on top from a physicality point of view and we struggled.
""The tightness of the league means that if you do get on a run, you're back in the play-off positions. We need to keep that belief. This has been a tough period for us - lots of guys have played five games on the bounce. We'll have to look at freshening things up.""
Glasgow head coach Franco Smith: ""It was fantastic. Everybody has chipped in and worked really hard. There's a lot of belief now. We fought well. The character of the boys - if we play to our strengths, we are a dangerous team.
""[Sione Tuipulotu] was really good. He's put up his hand for a lot of responsibility this season and he led the charge.""

sports	World Cup 2022: Giant Wales bucket hat unveiled in Doha	"A Welsh delegation will visit Qatar in the new year as the Welsh FA wants to ""help make the world a better place"", according to its chief executive.  
Noel Mooney said the team ""will not just pack up our tent"" at the end of the World Cup but play a continuing role in tackling issues in the country. 
His comments were made in Doha at the unveiling of a giant Welsh bucket hat.
First Minister Mark Drakeford and Welsh sport ambassadors Jess Fishlock and Colin Jackson were also at the event. 
More than 2,500 Wales fans are expected to be at Monday's opening match against the USA, marking Wales' return to the tournament after a 64 year absence. 
untry has been criticised for human rights concerns, including for its treatment of LGBTQ+ people and migrant workers.
At Sunday's unveiling, Mr Mooney said Qatar wanted to be ""a leader in the region for all these issues"" and legislative progress has occurred in the last few months on legacy funding, help for the families of workers who died, and a migrant centre. 
He said Wales would play its part through UEFA, adding: ""Just to be clear, we will be back here in January. 
""We won't just pack up our tent at the end of the tournament and go home to Cymru, we want to help make the world a better place."" 
Mr Mooney said the team ""really fancy our chances in this [World Cup] group"", adding ""we have a really good side"".
But he was quick to point out the tournament was about far more than football for the nation. 
It is not just the players being showcased to the globe but the culture and language, he said. 
""The bucket hat carries the words Gorau Chwarae, Cyd Chwarae [the team's moto - 'best play is team play'] and Ben Davies spoke in Welsh at a World Cup press conference for the first time ever yesterday. 
""It feels like a Gwyl Cymru [Welsh festival] is happening.""
For the first minister, it was more important to be in Qatar than not. 
Mr Drakeford's visit to the World Cup has drawn criticism, but he said the bucket hat ""will be seen by thousands and thousands of people from around the world in the coming weeks and is a symbol of the fact Wales are here, which is very important to us as a small nation"". 
He said the World Cup would ""take the name of Wales into living rooms across the world, many of which would never have heard of Wales before"".
""So it's an incredible opportunity to explain to people what we are as a nation - an outward looking nation where rights matter.""
Mr Drakeford flew in Saturday night and said he had not seen anything to concern him in ""the very brief time I have been here"".
""As I said in the run-up to coming here, there are concerns and reservations you have to take seriously,"" he said.
""But, in the end, we decided being here was more important.""
Mr Drakeford added: ""When you see the Welsh flag flying with the other 31, and those countries are all represented, it is important we are also here.""
He said he has a number of meetings with ""very senior people"" in the business industry planned and would be building ""major cultural relationships"" on his two day visit. 
Asked what the tangible benefits are of government delegations going to events such as this and the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, he said they are never known at the time but ""realised some months after when orders come through to Welsh companies and they have trade opportunities"". 
He said £2m spent on promoting Wales in Qatar would be returned ""many, many times over"", with the tournament creating huge exposure.
He also described the bucket hat as ""not just a work of art but with a very practical use as well"". 
""If you are at Heathrow Airport and lost and spot a bucket hat,"" he joked, ""then follow it and you can be sure you will end up in Doha.""
first minister will meet the Wales squad later on Sunday with a simple message. 
""I will tell them no pressure at all,"" he said.
""You are here to play football and to dare to dream, to go further if you can, but being here is the most important thing, an enormous achievement, and I hope the team spirit will sustain them through."" 
Legendary striker Ian Rush described Euro 2016 as ""special"" and that he wanted Wales on the biggest stage to become a regular occurrence. 
""I'm looking forward to seeing all the fans here, and singing,"" he said."
sports	Kimia Yousofi: Afghanistan sprinter and Olympic flag-bearer successfully relocated to Australia	"Afghanistan's Olympic flag-bearer Kimia Yousofi has been successfully relocated to Australia along with five Afghan families fleeing Taliban persecution. 
Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) said the athletes with ""ties to the Olympic movement"" had arrived in recent months following a 12-month project to bring them to safety.
In all, 31 family members have resettled in the country since June. 
""It's been a journey for me but I am very happy to be here,"" said Yousofi. 
""I am essentially starting a new life here.""
Sprinter Yousofi, 26, carried Afghanistan's flag at the opening ceremony of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games - which were postponed until last year because of the coronavirus pandemic - and took part in the women's 100m event. 
She is now hoping to compete at the Paris Olympics in 2024. 
""I am going to be training very hard, it would be exciting to go to Paris,"" she added.
Asian Games taekwondo medallist Ahmad Abasy was also part of the group relocated down under.
AOC liaised with the Australian government to secure visas and flights for the Afghan arrivals, while the International Olympic Committee (IOC) provided financial support during their time in interim locations.
""For the families involved, the stress and uncertainty over this time has been enormous,"" said AOC chief executive Matt Carroll. 
""Many have spent time in locations outside Afghanistan and it's wonderful to now have them on Australian soil. All arrived happy, if exhausted.
""These brave people have endured significant hardship and we are so pleased that our efforts have been successful.""
Australia evacuated more than 70 Afghan athletes, family members and officials a year ago as the Taliban came into power. 
Girls' and women's sport has since been suppressed by the Taliban government's hardline policies."
sports	UFC 281: Molly McCann aiming to end breakout year with third win	"Molly McCann has been one of the breakout fighters in the UFC this year - inside and outside the octagon.
32-year-old from Liverpool has provided two sensational spinning back elbow wins this year with triumphs over Luana Carolina in March and Hannah Goldy in July.
Both victories have seen 'Meatball' become one of the most recognisable names in the UFC.
""It's absolutely been mind-blowing, the love and appreciation and gratitude I've received around the world,"" McCann told BBC Sport.
""I'm not just talking Liverpool, I'm not just talking Ireland, everywhere I go people are just running at me and they just do the spinny elbow.""
McCann could make it three wins in a calendar year on Saturday with a victory against Erin Blanchfield in New York at UFC 281.
But the flyweight's extraordinary rise did not happen overnight.
McCann's journey in mixed martial arts started in 2013, but after two successive losses between 2020 to 2021 she considered her future in the sport. 
""To get the performances I've dreamed of and to put into practice the years of hard work is very special, and to have the recognition for what I've done is just boss,"" she said.
""It's set me up for where I'm supposed to be. I feel where I am in my fight IQ, I'm coming to my prime now and the notoriety is in alignment to that.""
However, McCann's success has come at a price and she admits to having struggled to adjust to the new heights of fame.
""Nothing teaches you how you can't walk down the street anymore and not be noticed, and not have a minute to yourself, and to make sure you are being who you need to be,"" McCann said.
""It hasn't been very easy at all. I've had to speak to a lot of people, I've had to work really hard because you can't be you anymore and I am public property now. 
""I'm 32 and for that to happen this late in the game is mad.""
McCann, who has 481,000 followers on Instagram, added: ""It's just taken a bit of time to understand that, and to know it shouldn't be a burden. 
""I've worked my whole life for this but you don't ask for fame, you ask for a world title, but with the fame - I don't like to say fame, I mean notoriety - I'm able to make a change and do things so you have to take the rough with the smooth.""
McCann, currently ranked 15 in the flyweight division, will fight at the iconic Madison Square Garden - something she envisioned when she attended Katie Taylor's victory over Amanda Serrano in April.
""Anyone who comes from boxing knows the importance of this arena,"" she said.
""I'm literally staying in a hotel in the middle of Times Square - sometimes it's a bit nuts to think this girl from Norris Green has absolutely made it to Madison Square Garden, so I'm just buzzing.""  
""It's always been my dream since I was a little meatball to fight at MSG, and when I was in there, when I watched the walkouts and took it in, it completely blew me away.
""I've got a picture standing outside, after the event, with my partner, and I was like 'that's going to be me one day', and low and behold, six months later, here we go.""
McCann's fight with Blanchfield is one of many intriguing fights taking place in New York.
At the top of the card is middleweight champion Israel Adesanya's highly-anticipated fight against Alex Pereira.
mpionship fight is a resuming of hostilities between the old rivals, who fought twice before in kickboxing. Pereira won both those encounters.
Brazilian Pereira is unbeaten in his three UFC fights and was fast-tracked to a title shot with Adesanya dominating the division since becoming champion in 2019.
Also in action is lightweight contender Dustin Poirier who faces former Bellator lightweight champion Michael Chandler in a mouthwatering clash.
Poirier, who has won seven fights from his last nine told BBC Sport he was relishing the opportunity to face Chandler and will not be underestimating him.
""He's very dangerous, big punches, a lot of power, super explosive, good wrestling, very high-level experience, he's very dangerous for sure,"" Poirier said.
Poirier, 33 is coming off a loss to former champion Charles Oliveira after two wins over Conor McGregor.
A win against Chandler will firmly put Poirier in the title picture again but 'The Diamond' isn't looking past his opponent on Saturday.
""I don't look too far ahead you know, you got to live in the now,"" he said."

sports	Global Solo Challenge: Sailor Dafydd Hughes' non-stop sea voyage	"A sailor is aiming to become only the second Welshman to go by sea single-handed and non-stop around the world. 
Dafydd Hughes, 62, from Tal-y-bont, Ceredigion, has registered to take part in 2023's Global Solo Challenge - a round-the-world sailing race. 
rts in A Coruña in Spain and sailors must travel east, passing between Antarctica and capes in South Africa, Australia and South America. 
He said he expected the voyage to take him more than six months. 
Completing the circumnavigation of the globe would see him follow Alex Thomson, from Bangor, who became the fastest Briton to sail solo, non-stop and unassisted around the world in 2017. 
Mr Thomson completed the journey in just under 75 days. 
Mr Hughes's boat, named Bendigedig - which means wonderful or fantastic in Welsh - has only just returned to the water after 20 years on dry land.
He bought it two years ago and has been working to make it seaworthy since. 
He said: ""She's had a full refit. She was completely stripped out when I bought her and she's now been fully rewired, fully plumbed, new tanks, new masts, all the deck fittings are new, the running rigs are new, new sails - so she's basically a new boat.""
34-ft (10m) vessel was ideal for the 26,000 nautical mile journey, Mr Hughes said. 
He has previously sailed around the world, as part of Sir Robin Knox-Johnston's crew in 2007, but doing it solo will be a challenge on an entirely new level. 
""When I first read about the race, I filled in my entry form within an hour. I sent it off and then I thought 'Oh my word what have I done now?' But I haven't lost the commitment since that day,"" he added. 
He said his biggest fear was a breaking wave on the side of the boat, with waves in the Southern Ocean reaching 60 or 70ft (20 to 23m), enough to roll the boat.
Bendigedig has been lowered into Aberaeron harbour and he will take it out to sea to test for just over two weeks it before taking on the Global Solo Challenge. 
Mr Hughes's sister, Sian Campion, said he was always looking for a challenge and was fond of an ""adrenaline rush"", and ""if he gets an idea in his mind he'll see it through until the end"". 
""He was keen on Formula 1 and had his own go-kart and went to races, he used to ride his bike or climb trees, he always had a craving for speed,"" she said. 
Global Solo Challenge, which is a new event, will start in September 2023. 
Entrants must head south from A Coruña and ""leave the Antarctic region and all known ice… to starboard (on the right) and the three great capes to port (on the left) before making their way to the finish line"".
ree capes are the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, Cape Leeuwin in Australia and Cape Horn in South America.
Mr Hughes said only 180 people have ever sailed around the world solo, fewer than the 600 who have been to space. 
He will not be allowed to be helped but will keep in touch with a shore team via satellite phone. 
He will also get lots of support from members of Aberaeron Yacht Club.
Its secretary Julian Driver said:  ""It's 24 hours a day, non-stop, so very little sleep. And when you get down in the Southern Ocean you could have 60 to 70ft waves and winds of 50mph (80km/h).
""Can he do it? He can, definitely. If anybody can, Dafydd will!"""

Elsewhere, the Golden State Warriors lost again without Stephen Curry.
""Who would have thought I would come into Toronto and hit my first game-winning buzzer-beater of my career?"" said Irving, who scored 32 points.
""Pray that there's more in the future, but I'm glad that we got this win.""
Nets coach Jacque Vaughn had originally drawn up the game-winning play for forward Kevin Durant, but they switched it to Irving as the team was coming out of its final timeout.
""It just comes with the trust that we're building here,"" said Irving.
""Jacque had a play call that we were about to go execute, and me and K had some dialogue and we decided to run the play for me. It was a good match-up versus Fred [VanVleet]. We just got the better of him that one time.
""I just want to be great in those situations,"" Irving added. ""You can say anything you want about me not hitting shots in the past, but the one time when you step up and make it, those are the ones you want to remember.""
Durant, who added 28 points for the Nets, said of Irving: ""He was already cooking, so I didn't want to get in his way.
""We kept finding him late in the game. He made some big shots, and I was just like, 'Jacque, I think Ky should take this one.'""
Elsewhere, James scored 30 points as the Los Angeles Lakers overcame a first-half injury to Anthony Davis to earn a 126-108 win over the Denver Nuggets.

Embiid had 34 points, 13 rebounds, four assists and four steals, while Harden added 27 points and nine assists as the Sixers claimed their fourth straight win.
Curry had his first game out with a shoulder injury, while Andrew Wiggins (thigh), Draymond Green (quad) and Andre Iguodala (hip) were also sidelined for defending champions Golden State, who are now 2-14 on the road and 14-16 overall."
sports	Rugby World Cup: What next for England and the women's game?	"England captain Sarah Hunter said the latest Rugby World Cup made her feel like ""finally people are just waking up to how great our sport is"".
Rugby Football Union chief executive Bill Sweeney agreed, saying the nail-biting final was ""probably more entertaining than the men's game"".
urnament in New Zealand was the best-attended women's World Cup ever, breaking the attendance record for a women's matchday twice - the opening-day attendance of 34,235 surpassed by the 42,579 sell-out Eden Park crowd for the final.
A turning point for women's rugby, but there is more to come.
Here, BBC Sport explores some of the main questions concerning the future of the game and England's team after their fifth World Cup final loss to New Zealand.
None of the Red Roses have announced their retirement since the final, but 37-year-old Hunter has already confirmed she will stop playing before a home World Cup in 2025.
Abbie Ward - a key player in England's formidable line-out - says she will ""100%"" continue until the next World Cup, while star centre Emily Scarratt, who is 32, is undecided.
She said losing a second successive final to New Zealand was ""certainly a driving force to win a World Cup"".
Scarratt said: ""I said to my mum when I saw her and gave her a big hug: 'Brace yourself, we might have to do another three years of this.'
""It's definitely not a decision to be made now. We'll see.""
Head coach Simon Middleton has also lost two World Cup finals in a row, and he is yet to confirm whether he wants to stay at the helm.
Middleton, whose reign has included a record 30-Test winning streak and four successive Six Nations titles, has a contract until the end of the 2023 Women's Six Nations.
Sweeney told BBC Radio 5 Live it was ""important to have some continuity"" after the World Cup, adding it ""would be good to have a woman"" leading England ""at some point"".
He said there was ""a raft of coaches"" on the RFU's radar to succeed Middleton and confirmed he would discuss the head coach's future when he is back in England.
RFU has led the way in investing in women's rugby since giving the Red Roses full-time contracts in 2019.
Other sides, including Wales and New Zealand, are now following suit in making their women's teams professional.
Black Ferns were only given contracts earlier this year, and Sweeney said it was ""a bit disappointing"" they won the World Cup despite a comparative lack of investment.
With the game still growing, both the Red Roses and the World Cup in New Zealand were run at a loss.
But Sweeney said England's final loss ""won't change the views on investment"", adding 70% of the fans at Eden Park on Saturday were new followers for New Zealand Rugby and women's rugby ""is good for the overall health of the game"".
World Rugby chief executive Alan Gilpin said the success of the tournament in New Zealand had ""given us confidence to invest more"".
In two weeks, England's players can return to play for their clubs in the Premier 15s - the most competitive women's domestic league in the world, which is also benefiting from increased RFU investment.
r next international outing will be in the 2023 Women's Six Nations, which starts on 26 March 2023.
In that tournament, England will tour the country as they play in Newcastle and Northampton before a first standalone fixture at Twickenham against France in what is likely to be the decider.
About 20,000 tickets have been sold for the Twickenham game, and Sweeney is confident that number will reach 40,000 - half the stadium's capacity.
RFU is also hopeful it can host World Rugby's new women's competition WXV in 2024, in preparation for a home World Cup in 2025.
Sweeney is aiming for the 2025 World Cup to break even and says ""we will fill Twickenham"" for the final ""and hopefully for the semi-final as well"".
Before that, the plan is to host matches in different regions around the country in what Sweeney says will be ""the best ever women's World Cup""."

Siobhan McGrath's early goal helped Galway side Sarsfields into an five-point lead but Loughgiel hit back.
Caitrin Dobbin netted and the teams were level at the break before Sarsfield burst clear with Rachel Murray firing in their second goal.
Loughgiel rallied again to equalise but Sarsfields finished strongly to win.
Earlier on Saturday at Croke Park, Down club Clonduff claimed the All-Ireland Intermediate title with a 0-12 to 1-6 victory over Kilkenny side James Stephens. 
Paula O'Hagan and Sara Louise Graffin combined for nine of Clonduff's scores as the Shamrocks secured the trophy for the second time, four years after the first.
It was a see-saw decider at headquarters with the outstanding Roisin McCormick firing over eight points for Loughgiel while the McGrath sisters - Siobhan and Niamh - were instrumental in Sarsfields securing their third All-Ireland crown.
Sarsfields made a blistering start with Siobhan McGrath shooting low into the net in the first minute and she added a point after team-mate Caoimhe Kelly slotted between the posts.
Mary McKillen put Loughgiel on the scoreboard and Niamh McGarth restored the five-point margin before the Ulster champions produced a run of 1-4 without reply, starting with points from Lucia McNaughton and McCormick.
Dobbin ran through before rifling into the bottom corner on 28 minutes and an Annie Lynn double left Loughgiel two points in front.
Kelly pulled one back and Klara Donohue registered the last point of the half to make it 1-6 to 1-6 at the break. 
McCormick edged Loughgiel back into the lead on the restart before Sarsfields seized control again with a 1-3 burst.

sports	King George VI Chase: Bravemansgame lands King George VI Chase	"Bravemansgame emerged from a battle with rival L'Homme Presse to give trainer Paul Nicholls a 13th win in the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park.
11-4 winner jumped the last just ahead but L'Homme Presse unseated jockey Charlie Deutsch on landing to leave the way clear.
wed Bravemansgame and jockey Harry Cobden, a winner on Clan Des Obeaux in 2018, to win by 14 lengths.
Royale Pagaille ran on for second with former winner Frodon third. 
Bravemansgame won the Kauto Star Novices' Chase on this day last season and marked his seasonal reappearance with victory in the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby with Nicholls always targeting this race for the seven-year-old.
Although Frodon was at the head of the field for much of the three-mile race, he started to fade turning from home, leaving Bravemansgame and L'Homme Presse to lead the way.
L'Homme Presse held a narrow advantage approaching the third fence from the finish, but Bravemansgame mastered him between the last two and took command.
Nicholls confirmed Bravemansgame would now head straight to March's Gold Cup at Cheltenham.
He said: ""It was a hell of a race. They went a good gallop and old Frodon gave them a good lead. He stayed on strong then and showed his strengths. He is just a maturing horse and we have trained him for today.
""We will go straight to Cheltenham now and we won't run him before the Gold Cup. On better ground he travels better than he did today, but he dug deep and stayed on. 
""The other horse was a little unfortunate to lose his pilot, but he was beaten by then.
""I'm thrilled. Who knows [what would have happened if L'Homme Presse had not come to grief at the last], but he wasn't stopping. He just jumped to the front and he would have been hard to go by. You can never be certain, but it looked that way to me watching. 
""I'm lucky enough to have the horses good enough to do it and the capability of a team that is good enough to get them right on the day.""
Earlier, Champion Hurdle favourite Constitution Hill earned a comfortable win in the Christmas Hurdle.
One of National Hunt's current stars, who went off at 1-7 under Nico de Boinville, was never troubled as he backed up his easy win in the Fighting Fifth at Newcastle last month with a 17-length win over stable-mate Epitante.
It was a fourth Grade One success for the five-year-old and an 11th win in the race for trainer Nicky Henderson.
""That was only his fifth race and again it was everything you'd hoped for,"" said Henderson.
""You just have to pray it all goes right. It's not that easy. It's not just a matter of going out there and coming back; you've got to jump hurdles and be in good shape - which he is - but so was Epatante, I haven't seen her look better.
""Aidan said she's probably run better than when she won this on the bridle last year, but he said he was only chasing shadows so it shows you what he is achieving - it's frightening really.""
Earlier, Paisley Park put in a strong finish to claim his third Long Walk Hurdle.
9-2 chance, who turns 11 on New Year's Day, struggled at one point and seemed to be out of contention.
But as the leading two Champ and Goshen looked to fight it out, Paisley Park found a second wind under Aidan Coleman to race clear.
Grade One race was scheduled to be held at Ascot earlier this month but was rescheduled because of bad weather.
""We didn't know what to expect but Aidan was calm,"" assistant trainer Barry Fenton told ITV Racing. ""He was a bit cold over the first two hurdles but I was happy going to the third last. 
""He kept plugging away and he's an unbelievable horse."""

Franklin, who took European gold last month, came through the course in 103.31 seconds - 1.17secs in front of France's Marjorie Delassus.
Chris Bowers also won gold for Britain in the men's extreme slalom, with Joe Clarke following Saturday's silver in the canoe slalom by taking the bronze.
Adam Burgess won Britain another bronze in the men's C1.
""I'm delighted to win gold here,"" said Mallory. ""It's my first senior final I've made in Krakow which is pretty surreal, but I am really happy with the run that I put down in the final. To come away with the win is great.""
Bowers got off to an excellent start off the ramp and went clear after choosing the left upstream gate with the rest of the competitors, including compatriot Clarke deciding to go right.
""It's awesome to win gold in the extreme slalom here,"" said Bowers. ""I feel like I missed out in the canoe slalom yesterday. The extreme is now a new opportunity for me which I'm embracing and managed to get the win, which is great.""

ree-time Grand Slam champion, 35, had hip surgery in 2018 and 2019.
And, while 2022 has been disappointing, a training block with coach Ivan Lendl in Florida has convinced him he is fit enough to compete at the top level.
""If my body is in good shape and I'm still able to compete consistently, I'll keep playing,"" Murray said.
""But I can't look so far in advance with the age I'm at and with the issues I've had. If I was to have a big injury, I probably wouldn't try to come back from that.""
Murray played 45 singles matches in 2022, winning 26 and reaching finals in Stuttgart and Sydney to reach an end-of-year ranking of 49.
His best run in a Grand Slam was reaching the third round of the US Open, where he lost in four sets to Matteo Berrettini.
former world number one will be part of the Scotland team taking on England in the Battle of the Brits in Aberdeen over the next two days.
Murray will face Jack Draper on Wednesday and Dan Evans on Thursday, before teaming up with brother Jamie - who has arranged the event - to play Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski.
After that, the two-time Olympic gold medallist is targeting improved performances at the Grand Slams next year, starting at the Australian Open in January.
""I spent three weeks in Florida, getting my body right and getting some work done on my game and it went really well,"" he said.
""I'm certainly in better shape than I was. A lot of work was done in the gym, trying to build up my endurance and my stamina a bit and I'm hoping that's going to help me next year.
""I wasn't happy with how last season went - certainly the last six months or so from a physical perspective - but my ranking still went from 125 to 50 in a year. I'm hoping that this year, with the work I've done, things will continue to improve and I'll still be motivated to get out there and compete."""

rvice is being trialled by the health board and Mercury Drone Ports.
rial route has been approved by the Federal Aviation Authority.
Future trials will carry supplies and samples between other healthcare facilities in Dundee and Angus.
Angus Council leader Beth Whiteside said she hoped the trial would demonstrate how it could help reduce testing times and speed up diagnoses for patients.
NHS Tayside said it hoped the trial would help develop and improve its supply chain, and provide an equitable level of healthcare, regardless of a patient's geographical location.
Chris Hind, the health board's diagnostics laboratories interim quality manager, said: ""NHS Tayside plans to extend phlebotomy testing hours at some regional medical practices. 
""We are very interested in testing additional logistical support to transport patient samples, which would permit samples to be taken at later times than currently possible for delivery to the main testing lab at Ninewells Hospital.""

technology	Why is Elon Musk spending his time on Twitter, not on the mission to Mars?	"I have been watching Elon Musk for a number of years - and more closely than ever in recent months, since he decided, seemingly on a whim, to buy the social network Twitter.
He is one of the world's richest men - sometimes the richest, depending on the price of Tesla shares, his main financial asset. With a string of other high-profile companies under his wing, including Tesla, Space X, Starlink, and Neuralink, he is also a subject of global fascination. 
, of course, there is his own personal story - the tall, 51-year-old billionaire with 10 children ranging in age from one to 18. His first son died aged just 10 weeks. Musk, who was born in South Africa, has described living with Asperger's syndrome, a type of autism, and stated that his main goal in life is to colonise Mars. 
What I have learned is - as, perhaps, with many of us - there are many different faces of Elon Musk.
rsona he projects via his prolific tweets is provocative, controversial and bombastic. He loves a rude meme, knows whatever he says will make headlines around the world, and enjoys trolling the media with ever more outlandish statements and jokes. He likes trying to goad us journalists into writing ever more extreme headlines.
In public, he has learned to be a showman, whether dancing alongside electric-car-making robots, emerging triumphantly from the latest slick Tesla prototype, or being filmed walking into Twitter's headquarters carrying a sink - ""Let that sink in"" was the gag, playing off a popular meme on the site. This Halloween, he attended a party in leather armour, a $7,500 costume called ""the devil's champion"".
And yet Tallulah Riley, his ex-wife, whom he married twice, described him in BBC documentary series The Elon Musk Show as ""sweet"" and ""shy"". 
Veteran Silicon Valley journalist and author Mike Malone, who has known Mr Musk for 20 years, tells me he sees  ""a very reserved, very smart, very introspective and intellectual guy"" who spends long transatlantic flights with him reading complex trajectory tables, trying to work out how to land a spacecraft on Mars. 
r have a long-standing $5 (£4) bet over Mr Musk's ambition to send people to Mars by 2030. ""I said, 'I don't think you can do it - but I hope you do. I hope I owe you the $5,'"" Mr Malone says. ""That bet's still floating in the air"".
Sending people to Mars is a lifelong goal for Mr Musk. Some say it is his take on long-termism - a philosophy favoured by some very rich people which seeks to act in the interests of billions of people in the far future, rather than focusing on the immediate needs of the present.
At some point, the human race is going to have to leave Earth, he says. And his interest in space is clearly signposted in his existing business portfolio. But where, on Earth, does Twitter fit in? 
Mr Musk answered that question, this week - in a tweet.
""Social media in general, especially Twitter, were eroding civilisation,"" he wrote. ""If civilisation collapses before Mars becomes self-sustaining, then nothing else matters. Human consciousness is gone.""
But how was Twitter ""eroding civilisation""? 
Mr Musk said, at the very beginning, his aim in buying the platform was to create a 21st Century digital, global town square for discussing society's big issues. 
He has written many times about perceived imbalance under the previous regime, arguing that right-leaning views were given less visibility by Twitter staff than left-leaning ones, skewing debate and creating echo chambers where nobody saw material that challenged their existing viewpoint. With some handpicked journalists, he published the ""Twitter files"", a selected set of internal documents, to support his view.
mount of abuse and misinformation thrown around on the platform could also be seen as distracting from the real issues Mr Musk wants discussed.
But as anyone who has ever tried will know, navigating that tightrope between allowing free speech and suppressing hateful content is very, very hard.
Maybe there is a connection somewhere in Mr Musk's mind between Twitter and Neuralink, which is trying to create a direct link between human brains and computers. 
Could it be that Twitter forms part of his research and he has essentially bought himself a living, breathing neural network of 300 million people sharing their lives, and opinions, in real time, online? 
OK, we are in the realms of science fiction. But transporting that to another planet in some form would be one way of taking human consciousness away from Earth - and we know Mr Musk likes a challenge.
Mr Malone may never see his $5 - and betting against Mr Musk is generally a bad idea, entrepreneur Dolly Singh, who worked with him for six years at SpaceX, until 2013, says.
""I would, by rule, never bet against him,"" she says.
""Anything that's a machine - hands down, he's going to win.""  
But Ms Singh also thinks Twitter presents her former boss with a different challenge. 
""This is going to be harder than he has anticipated - and it's going to be a lot of work for him,"" she says.
Mr Musk has talked openly about preferring engineering and code to people. Growing up, he did not understand people did not necessarily say what they meant, he told a Technology, Entertainment, Design (Ted) conference in Vancouver, last year.
In a text message, released as part of court papers for a legal case against Twitter that never actually happened, he wrote: ""I interface way better with engineers who are able to do hardcore programming than with program managers/MBA [Master of Business Administration] types of people and/or frankly I hate doing mgmt [management] stuff. I kinda don't think anyone should be the boss of anyone. But I love helping solve technical/product design problems.""
His problem is that Twitter is one huge messy network of millions of people shouting, laughing, teasing, trolling, arguing - loud, complex and nuanced. 
Mr Musk has already struggled with trying to moderate it, even with a promise of a lighter touch than the previous regime. 
And Ms Singh is not the only observer to ask whether he will find it more difficult to run smoothly than he imagined. 
As a businessman and a leader, he can be brutal - although arguably no more so than other chief executives. 
Within one week of buying Twitter, he had laid off half the workforce. Those remaining were asked to sign contracts committing to an ""intense"" work ethic and long hours. 
Pre-Twitter, he was one of the first to call for the staff of all his companies to be back at the workplace full time following pandemic lockdowns. 
And he will not tolerate less than 100% commitment from his employees.
Ms Singh describes the Musk she knew as an ""incredible leader"", determined to ""prove everybody wrong"" when told he cannot achieve something, and, as is often said about him, a phenomenally hard worker.
""Elon wants to live in a world where he works 80 hours a week,"" she says.
""It's OK for him to say, 'I expect you to work as hard as me,' because he's not phoning it in from the beach, he's sleeping in a sleeping bag on the factory floor.""
Most people, she says, burn out after a while. He does not.
He has installed beds in Twitter's San Francisco headquarters, seemingly for his staff - although, he is understood to be sleeping there himself. He even shared a picture of his two-year-old son, X, wearing a company pass. 
Others who worked with him in the 1990s also recall his extraordinary work ethic. He was furious, one said, to find nobody in the office at 21:00 on a Friday night.
Ms Singh says his time is Mr Musk's most precious commodity. 
""Think about what it's worth, per second,"" she says. 
You do not need to do the maths to know it is eye-watering. 
And right now, he is pouring it all into Twitter. 
Perhaps Mr Malone should not spend his $5 just yet.

technology	Robot with 'brain' near Cheltenham sorting plastic waste	"A waste management company is trialling the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to sort plastic waste.
Grundon has invested in a robotic arm at its Bishop's Cleeve site in Gloucestershire which can pick rubbish at ""a human rate"".
Zen Robotics machine learns to remember plastic in a similar way to which humans learn to recognise items.
mpany hopes the technology will increase the volume of recyclable material Grundon can capture.
'Fast Picker' arm is supplied by Helsinki-based supplier of robotic waste separation technology - Zen Robotics.
It works by scanning rubbish on a belt before deciding which items to pick - the robot then has an ""in-belt brain"" of information which it retains through training.
Over time, as more items are picked, the ""brain"" identifies more waste streams, storing the information in its AI memory.
Government statistics show the UK generated almost 44 million tonnes of commercial and industrial waste in 2018.
mate for England - in 2020 - was almost 34 million tonnes.
Once plastic trials are complete, Grundon will begin training the robot to pick steel or aluminium cans, paper and cardboard.
Ed Fagan, Grundon's head of projects, said: ""Both optical and robotic sorters can be deployed alongside humans in our waste sorting facilities.
""But where we can really see robotic sorters making a difference is in environments which are less well suited for humans, such as the sorting of contaminated waste or working in areas with high levels of noise and dust.""

technology	Ruja Ignatova: Leaked police notes may have alerted FBI-wanted Cryptoqueen	"Ruja Ignatova, also known as the ""missing Cryptoqueen"", received police information about investigations into her $4bn (£3.5bn) cryptocurrency fraud before she disappeared, it is claimed.
42-year-old Bulgarian-born woman is wanted for her alleged role in running a cryptocurrency scam known as OneCoin.
Files seen by the BBC from Europol meetings suggest the FBI-wanted fugitive knew about efforts to arrest her months before she vanished. 
uments were passed to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast by Frank Schneider, a former spy and trusted adviser to Ms Ignatova.
Mr Schneider denies obtaining the documents, which he says were passed to him on a USB memory stick by Ms Ignatova. He claims metadata on the files suggests she obtained the information via her own contacts in Bulgaria. 
He is now facing extradition to the US for his alleged role in the OneCoin fraud. 
Europol said it was looking into the issue. 
Ms Ignatova disappeared on 25 October 2017 after being tipped off about intensifying police investigations into her OneCoin cryptocurrency. In June 2022, she was added to the FBI's 10 most wanted list.
files contain presentations made at an ""Operation Satellite"" Europol meeting in The Hague on 15 March 2017.
According to the documents, the meeting was attended by the FBI, the US Department of Justice and the New York District Attorney. Officers from the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Dubai and Bulgaria were also present.
uments include details of US authorities having a ""high-placed confidential informant"", OneCoin bank accounts receiving investor funds, and unsuccessful efforts by the UK's City of London Police to interview Ms Ignatova.
FBI did not comment on the Europol documents, but Special Agent Paul Roberts told the podcast: ""There were investigations all around the world into her, and into OneCoin generally, many of which she had become aware of due to actions by law enforcement in other countries.""
In court, US prosecutors alleged in 2019 that Mr Schneider was the one who provided her with confidential police information, although it is not clear if the allegations relate specifically to the leaked files seen by the podcast.
He has denied obtaining the documents and said: ""When the Bulgarians participated at certain Europol meetings, it only took hours for her to get a complete rundown and get the minutes of what was said in those meetings.
""I can only deduce that it came from the circles that she was in and the connections that she had through a variety of influential personalities.""
uments show attendees from Bulgaria's Interior Ministry at the March 2017 Europol meeting. The BBC asked the ministry whether its staff could be responsible for the leak, but it did not comment. 
No other law enforcement bodies in attendance would confirm how the information got out. 
Europol told the BBC it was looking into the matter, adding: ""This complex scenario with many stakeholders makes it difficult to assess where and how such an incident might have occurred.""
US Department of Justice, New York County District Attorney's Office, and Dubai Police did not comment.
Listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast on BBC Sounds - the search for Dr Ruja Ignatova continues, with a new episode about the police leak out on 19 October.

technology	Twitter: Romance, business and campaigns born on the platform	"For those who work there and those who use it, Twitter continues to be on a rollercoaster under the leadership of Elon Musk, who bought the firm for $44bn (£36.3m) at the end of October.
umult has brought into sharper focus some of the platform's failings. Like all social networks, Twitter has long grappled with problems regarding privacy, hate speech and abuse.
But for some of its roughly 300 million monthly users, it has also been a place where they have built businesses, found love, launched campaigns and raised awareness for issues that are important to them.
I spoke to three women who say being on Twitter changed their lives for the better.
Catherine Cooke is a teaching assistant 
I didn't start out looking for romance. But what I did use Twitter for was support, it's quite an isolating thing going through a divorce. And you can of course talk to real-life friends and family, but sometimes they're a little bit too close. Sometimes it's just very useful to have a sounding board. 
You can have a vent and a rant. And there's somebody there who will either be sympathetic or maybe tell you off, but you will definitely get a reaction, and probably some quite honest feedback as well. I started off really using Twitter as a bit of a diary.
Along the way, I found lots of people who were going through the same thing or had been through the same thing, and had useful information or advice.
As far as the romance side of it goes, really that came out of friendships I'd made on Twitter. I like music and I got chatting to people about it. One of those people eventually ended up being my partner. But it did start out in friendship, a shared love of music and general chit-chat.
I love Twitter. There's so many people out there that I feel very, very strongly about even though we've never met, which does sound a bit weird. Online friends are a different sort of friend from real-life friends, but they're really important. I feel like I couldn't have got through the last couple of years without those people. I'm very positive about Twitter, I think it can be an absolute force for good.
witter has changed my life, I can't believe I'm actually saying that but it's true. I've gone from being on my own and going through divorce, to feeling that I've met the love of my life. I would never have met him if it hadn't been for Twitter. I feel really, really lucky.
Gail Myerscough is an illustrator and pattern designer
witter has been amazing. I've got 18,400 followers, so I've got a real audience for my work. But it's also been really supportive. People have been with me on my journey. I was made redundant in Covid - this was my side hustle and then it became my full-time job. I also met my husband on Twitter. 
I've got brand ambassadors now on Twitter who retweet me, I've got repeat customers. I've worked with some amazing people. Tim Burgess from the band The Charlatans contacted me one day and said, ""I really like your work"". And then he asked me to design a turntable for him. So we designed a limited-edition turntable - it was brilliant.
I get a lot of traffic from Twitter.  I do have Instagram, but the algorithms and engagement make it more difficult to get people to look at your work.
I'm really worried about what's happening [since Elon Musk took over] because like I say, a lot of my business and support comes from Twitter. If Twitter went, I'd have to build my business elsewhere, and I don't know where that would be to get the same engagement and orders. 
Suw Charman-Anderson founded Ada Lovelace Day, an annual celebration of women working in Stem (science, tech, engineering and maths)
I started the Ada Lovelace Day Twitter account at the end of 2008. And at that point, the idea of having a day celebrating women in Stem - well it was just an idea. I didn't have any resources or any way to reach people. Twitter was the obvious solution. In all honesty, I don't think Ada Lovelace Day would have become the movement that it did without the help of Twitter.
We have 40% of our audience in the UK, and about 40% in North America. The other 20% is in about 150 countries around the world. So we have followers from across South America, Africa, Asia, it has allowed us to reach people in countries where the media isn't going to pick us up.
With a bit of care, it has been possible to curate an experience on Twitter that is generally pleasant. Obviously, there is always the opportunity for things to go wrong. I have experienced the Twitter pile-on - not quite becoming the main character thankfully, but adjacent to it - and that is never pleasant. 
But overall, I think it has been a positive experience for me and I am grateful to Twitter for allowing Ada Lovelace Day to flourish in the way that it has. I see other organisations for women in Stem and all sorts of other things that exist because Twitter connects them with their community and their audience in a way that other tools just don't. 
I just don't see the same level of engagement on Facebook or LinkedIn for example. I think Twitter is interesting, it's unique in its properties, and I would be really heartbroken if it did break permanently or if we saw a huge drop off in numbers.

Kate McKenzie, from Duston, Northampton, created a tool called Word Windows, which will now be known as Word Window.

""The premise is you can put on top of the book your child is reading so you can reduce it so you can read with whatever bit of the word they are struggling with,"" Mrs McKenzie said.
She said she created the device as she struggled with reading at school due to dyslexia and her son was facing similar issues.
Nine days before the product was due to go to market, on 1 July, she received a letter from lawyers representing Microsoft.
But she told BBC Radio Northampton: ""Everything is now resolved, the packaging has been reprinted, all the bits and pieces have been changed in terms of the website.""
Mrs McKenzie said although the name has slightly changed ""the product is the same"".
She will be launching the invention at Northamptonshire Central Library, in Northampton, on Saturday, which she was ""feeling a little bit nervous about"".
Mrs McKenzie said: ""One of the aspects of my dyslexia is I can find myself stumbling and stuttering over words.
""But the actual chance to launch the business to get started and to start to help parents and the children is very exciting.""

technology	Floppy disks in Japan: Minister declares war on old-fashioned technology	"Japan's digital minister has ""declared war"" on floppy disks and other retro tech used by the country's bureaucrats.
Around 1,900 government procedures still require businesses to use the storage devices, plus CDs and mini-discs, Taro Kono said. 
He said regulations would be updated to allow people to use online services. 
Despite its reputation for innovative high-tech gadgetry, Japan is notorious for clinging to outmoded technology through its office culture.
Floppy disks - so-called because the original products were bendable - were created in the late 1960s, but were falling out of fashion three decades later thanks to more efficient storage solutions.
More than 20,000 typical disks would be needed to replicate an average memory stick storing 32GB of information.
But the legacy of the square-shaped device can still be witnessed to this day, as their visual appearance inspired the traditional ""save"" icon. 
A Japanese government committee has discovered about 1,900 areas in which businesses are required to use storage media like floppy disks when making applications or holding data. 
During a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Kono also criticised the country's lingering use of other outdated technology.
""I'm looking to get rid of the fax machine, and I still plan to do that,"" he said.
urning to storage devices, he asked: ""Where does one even buy a floppy disk these days?""
first time Japan has hit the headlines for its old-fashioned habits - which remain a paradox given the country's proficiency at developing exciting new products. 
Various explanations have been offered, including poor digital literacy and a bureaucratic culture with conservative attitudes.
re was shock when the country's cyber-security minister admitted in 2018 that he had never used a computer, saying he had always delegated IT tasks to his staff.
And it was not until 2019 that Japan's final pager provider closed its service, with the final private subscriber explaining that it was the preferred method of communication for his elderly mother.
Officials in the US were also discovered to still be using floppy disks to manage their nuclear weapons force during the 2010s - though this practice was reportedly scrapped by the end of the decade."

Some users on Instagram try to skirt its 13+ age rule by editing their date of birth to make them appear over 18.
But US teens attempting this will now be given three ways to verify age: upload ID, ask three adult users to vouch for them or take a video selfie.
Meta says it hopes the new methods will ensure teens have an ""age-appropriate experience"" on Instagram. 
giant has previously faced criticism over teen and child safety on its platforms. 
Several US states probed Instagram last year over children's experiences on the photo-sharing app, in response to leaks from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen. 
Will Gardner OBE, chief executive of Childnet and director of the UK Safer Internet Centre, says the trial is encouraging: ""The potential is there to try and help protect children from content which isn't for them and make their internet experience more age-appropriate."" 
5Rights Foundation, a UK organisation campaigning for child safety in the digital environment, says such efforts are ""long overdue"".
Platforms should ""leave behind the 'don't look don't see attitude' that has led to millions of children being put at risk"", 5Rights says, adding that ""simply knowing the age of your users is not enough.""
Parents and guardians of teen Instagram users were given additional tools to supervise their child's experience on Instagram earlier this month. 
w set up time limits and view details of any reports their child makes on the platform.
will also be ""nudged"" to look at other content if repeatedly viewing the same topics on Instagram's explore page, and encouraged to ""take a break"" if continuously scrolling through reels.
Video selfies have become a popular way for digital platforms - such as online banking apps - to verify users' age or identity. 
Instagram currently uses video selfies as one way account holders can verify their identity if they get locked out of their account. 
Meta has partnered with UK digital identification provider Yoti, whose technology estimates age by analysing human faces and facial features.
Yoti says its algorithm, trained on anonymous people's facial images and their date of birth, cannot individually identify users or anything about them, except their age. 
Its latest white paper, published in May, said the technology was accurate for six to 12-year-olds with an error range of 1.36 years - and an error range of 1.52 years for 13 to 19-year-olds. 
Meta says both companies will delete the image once a user's age has been confirmed. 
Meanwhile, social vouching allows users to ask three mutual followers to confirm their age. Those being asked to confirm how old a user is must be at least 18, and cannot be vouching for any other users at the time. 
Dr Ysabel Gerrard, lecturer in digital media and society at the University of Sheffield, says Instagram's new age-verification methods are a welcome addition to just asking users to upload ID. 
But she says relying on age-verification tools as a way to protect young people online can overlook why they actually try to create adult accounts in the first place. 
""A lot of them are saying they're 18 on Instagram not to do bad things or view bad content,"" Dr Gerrard says.
""Being technically registered as an adult makes them feel safe because they don't think they're going to be targeted.""
For Dr Gerrard, Instagram's new verification mechanisms raise larger questions about what helps children to feel safe on social media platforms.
""Pretending to be an adult is one of them. It's a harsh reality, but we can't pretend it's not happening."""
technology	EU Parliament approves common charging cable from 2024	"European MPs have voted for a law requiring all new portable devices to use the same type of charging cable.
Smartphones and tablets, including the Apple iPhone and iPad, would have to use a USB-C charger from 2024, while laptop manufacturers would have until 2026 to make the change.
re were 602 votes in favour and 13 against, with eight abstaining.
Member states are expected to grant approval on 24 October, before the rule is signed into law at the parliament.
Following a provisional agreement by the European Union, in June 2022, the UK government told BBC News it was not ""currently considering"" introducing a common charging cable.
But under the current post-Brexit arrangements, the new regulation could apply to Northern Ireland.
""new requirements may also apply to devices sold in Northern Ireland under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit agreement, potentially triggering divergence of product standards with the rest of the UK"", according to a December 2021 parliamentary report.
reaty works by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods, while the rest of the UK is outside it.
A row between the UK and EU about how to reform the Northern Ireland protocol remains unresolved.
EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager celebrated the new rule on Twitter, citing the ""waste and inconvenience"" of having multiple chargers.
But Apple has historically argued against the proposal.
When it was first introduced, in September 2021, an Apple representative told BBC News: ""Strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world"".
gy giant is the main manufacturer of smartphones using a custom charging port, as its iPhone series uses an Apple-made Lightning connector.
Apple has been approached for comment.
w rule will cover a range of ""small and medium-sized portable electronics"", according the EU, including:"

Stores in Northampton, Milton Keynes and Cambourne, Cambridgeshire, already use the autonomous vehicles in partnership with Starship Technologies.
North Northamptonshire Council said Wellingborough, Rushden and Higham Ferrers would now be able to access the service.
Conservative councillor Graham Lawman said it was ""extremely exciting"".
ry-run council has joined with four Co-op stores to bring the service to 45,000 residents across 33,000 households in the three initial locations.
Mr Lawman described them as ""rather cute delivery robots"".
""This new service is another innovation that we are supporting to help to provide a clean and green alternative to the private car for day-to-day convenience shopping, helping to reduce emissions,"" he said.
firm behind the robots said in an average delivery journey they used energy equivalent to that needed for a kettle to boil a cup of water.
robots were lightweight and could travel at human walking pace - no faster than 4mph (6km/h).

technology	Molly-Mae Hague has Pretty Little Thing Instagram post banned	"Molly-Mae Hague has had another Instagram post banned, this time after she failed to include any mention of it being an ad.
It's the third time the 23-year-old influencer has been in trouble with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).
She posted a picture of her wearing a Pretty Little Thing (PLT) dress, along with a link to buy it, on her story.
ASA said it was not ""immediately clear"" that she had a commercial interest in PLT.
Molly-Mae is a creative director at the company, with PLT confirming their contract expressly stated the requirement for her to include the ""£ad"" disclosure in posts.
Someone who saw the former Love Islander's post on Halloween last year complained, saying the ad didn't make its commercial intent clear.
ASA said: ""We noted that the story had appeared in Molly-Mae Hague's own account and did not contain any indication that it was a marketing communication.""
A spokeswoman for Molly-Mae said the ""#ad"" disclosure had been left off by mistake and would be used in future.
PLT also said it had reminded Molly-Mae of the requirement to prevent any similar mistakes in future.
rd time Molly-Mae has been called out by the ASA since 2020.
But she is by no means the first influencer to have been ticked off for not labelling an ad correctly on social media.
Newsbeat spoke to the ASA's compliance executive Ed Senior last year and he told us that ""overall compliance was disappointing"".
rules say content has to ""be clear, obvious and identifiable as advertising"".
Putting a hashtag #ad is one way, but he says they could also verbally say it's an advert at the start of a video.
""It needs to be clear and obviously up front, prior to engagement. So that's why, even when they added #ad at the end, it wouldn't be enough to comply with the rules,"" Ed said.
But what happens if the rules are broken?
As you'd expect, there are different levels of sanctions.
Ed says the ASA will get someone to amend the content so it follows the rules, or get them to remove it.
If things escalate, people can be placed on a public list, with the ASA working with platforms to remove further content and eventually even referring them to legal authorities.
ASA has told Newsbeat there are measures in place specifically for influencers, including a non-compliance webpage which lists people who fail to label their content as ads - so naming and shaming basically.
From January, there has also been an ""on-platform targeted ads sanction"" on a handful of influencers who have been either unwilling or unable to consistently label when their posts are ads.
""We took out ads on Instagram, specifically flagging influencers who routinely break our rules and warning consumers about their content,"" a spokesman added.
Newsbeat has asked Molly-Mae's management for any additional comment.

technology	Security warning after sale of stolen Chinese data	"President Xi Jinping has urged public bodies to ""defend information security"" after a hacker offered to sell stolen data of one billion Chinese citizens.
In an advert on a criminal forum, later removed, the user said the data was stolen from Shanghai National Police.
ker claims the information includes names, addresses, National ID numbers and mobile phone numbers. 
Cyber-security experts have verified that at least some of a small sample of the data offered is real.
23 terabytes of data is thought to be the largest ever sale of data on record and was being offered for $200,000 (£166,000) until the post was removed on Friday.
No Chinese officials have responded to the news and President Xi did not make direct reference to the data sale.
But, according to the South China Morning Post, the president has asked public bodies in China to ""defend information security… to protect personal information, privacy and confidential corporate information"" to ensure people feel secure when submitting data for public services.
On Friday, the moderators of the website where the sale was listed - by a user called ChinaDan - posted a notice which read: ""Dear Chinese users, welcome to our forum. You most likely came here because of the Shanghai police database leak. The data is no longer being sold, and posts related to this topic have been deleted.""
website administrators then added that they have many other similar and high quality Chinese databases for sale, adding: ""We are not in China and we are not Chinese, so we do not have to obey Chinese laws.""
According to DarkTracer, which monitors cyber criminal activity, another hacker - perhaps inspired by the publicity surrounding ChinaDan's offer - posted an advert on Tuesday for 90 million Chinese citizen records, which the hacker claims to have stolen from Henan National Police (HNGA). None of that data has been verified.
""It remains unclear exactly why the data has been withdrawn,"" Toby Lewis, global head of threat analysis at Darktrace said. 
""The original offer of sale suggests that the hacker was looking to sell the data to several buyers without exclusivity, rather than just one. 
""So one theory is that for a high enough price exclusivity could have been bought, and that kind of purchase could possibly have been made by the Chinese state itself.""
Mr Lewis believes the leaked information could have been a major concern for Chinese authorities which reportedly blocked discussions of the sale on Chinese social networks shortly after it was advertised.
Deb Leary, CEO of Forensic Pathways, also believes the data may have been sold to a high bidder, but adds: ""It's interesting, and not unexpected, that the hacker forum used the incident as a way to promote themselves as a go-to place for stolen data. 
""They don't seem to be worried about angering the Chinese authorities.""
In April a popular hacking website called Raid Forums was seized and shut down in an international police operation led by the FBI. 
's Portuguese founder, and a British man based in Croydon, were arrested.
Large data sets such as the Chinese cache can be used by hackers to send impersonation emails and other malicious attacks to trick people into handing over cash to criminals.
But now the data has disappeared it may never be possible to verify it.
Another theory is that the data and ChinaDan could have been discovered to be fake by the website administrators.
However Louise Ferrett, Threat Analyst at Searchlight Security, thinks the data could well be genuine.
""There are indications that the data on sale was legitimate. Firstly, the source of the data has been reported by some security teams as human error on the part of a government developer,"" she said.
""Secondly, multiple sources have confirmed that the sample data that the seller, known as ChinaDan, provided was legitimate. 
""This doesn't necessarily mean the entire database was real but these two elements combined do certainly make it more likely,"" said Mrs Ferrett. "
technology	UK set to have world's biggest automated drone superhighway	"UK is set to become home to the world's largest automated drone superhighway within the next two years.
rones will be used on the 164-mile Skyway project connecting towns and cities, including Cambridge and Rugby.
It is part of a £273m funding package for the aerospace sector which will be revealed by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng on Monday.
Other projects include drones delivering mail to the Isles of Scilly and medication across Scotland.
Mr Kwarteng is to announce the news at the Farnborough International Airshow - the first to be held since 2019.
He will say the funding will ""help the sector seize on the enormous opportunities for growth that exist as the world transitions to cleaner forms of flight"".
Dave Pankhurst, director of drones at BT, told the BBC that Skyway is about scaling up trials that have been taking place around the UK.
BT is one of the partners involved in the collaboration.
""This drone capability has existed for quite some time, but is in its infancy in terms of being actually part of our society and being a usable application,"" he said. 
""So for us, this is about taking a significant step towards that point. It's going to open up so many opportunities.""
Skyway aims to connect the airspace above Reading, Oxford, Milton Keynes, Cambridge, Coventry and Rugby by mid-2024, and will receive more than £12m.
A total of £105.5m of the government's funding will be specifically for projects relating to ""integrated aviation systems and new vehicle technologies"", including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as drones.
rojects include a plan to use drones to provide regular deliveries of mail and medicine to the Isles of Scilly, and to distribute medicines across Scotland, potentially enabling some cancer patients to be treated in their local community.
Chris Forster, chief operating officer of aviation technology company Altitude Angel, said there were a lot of potential uses for the superhighway.
""Whether it be a business doing logistics, all the way to the police and medical deliveries of vaccines and blood samples, there's a real demand to have access to this airspace,"" he said. 
""We've done a few projects in Africa where the road infrastructure was not good for ground vehicles, and the delivery of vaccines was provided by automated drones.""
gy utilises ground-based sensors installed along the highway which provide a real-time view of where drones are in the airspace.
raffic management system - a sort of air traffic control for drones - which guides them along their routes and avoids collisions.
Steve Wright, associate professor in aerospace engineering at UWE Bristol, said the biggest concern regarding crashes does not come when the drone is in the air, but during take-off or landing.
""It's about the first and last bit of the flight,"" he said. ""The problem is what happens when you're 10 feet away from people. That's the bit I spend my time worrying about. 
""When it's up in the air I know it's stable and it's not going to hit something. 
""People are looking at lowering packages down from the air - in other words you keep the drone well away from people. There's lots of very bright people out there working on flight plans that deliberately avoid built-up areas.""
Mr Pankhurst said the project was working alongside the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to ensure safety. 
""The way they work as an organisation is very evidence-based,"" he said. ""Safety is just paramount in this industry, but importantly, nothing happens without the regulator actually signing it off. 
""The CAA is part of all of these future flight projects. It is part of all of these activities, validating the progress and making sure they're safe.""
He said its research showed that people are more likely to accept a drone if they know it is providing an important service.
Simon Jude, senior lecturer at Cranfield University, said: ""People's knowledge and attitudes might change if they know what that UAV is being used for. If it's an emergency medical support, you're probably going to be a lot more accepting of the noise. 
""So what happens if you get multiple UAVs, or an agricultural use where you might get a number of drones collecting and saving data all at once? 
""I live in a rural location, a very quiet location and it might annoy me more than if you were in a city or an urban landscape where there's lots of other noise."" "
technology	Mario Kart: Next game could be 'victim of current title's success'	"most successful racing video game franchise of all time started with a simple concept.
In 1992, Nintendo released Super Mario Kart on their Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) console.
game was produced by Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto and followed the release of F-Zero - a well-received debut on the console for another popular racing series - but as a single-player experience, the company wanted to take things further.
ment team set out to create a two-player racing game which displayed both players on the same game screen simultaneously. But due to the limitations of the SNES, it wouldn't have been possible to illustrate the futuristic high speeds of F-Zero, so it needed to slow things down a bit. 
As a result, they decided to go with karts. However, it wasn't originally planned to feature Mario, Princess Peach and friends. 
A few months into development, when they had a prototype of two karts featuring generic racers of guys in overalls, they decided to see how Mario would look in the game. According to Miyamoto, everyone agreed it looked better with the inclusion of their famous mascot and so, the Mario Kart series was born.
Industry analyst Serkan Toto of Kantan Games describes the title as a ""system seller"" for the SNES.
""Already back then, Nintendo was leveraging the Mario brand,"" he tells the BBC. ""So they put Mario in there to sell more copies of the game than with, for example, a new character that they would have to come up with.
""It actually made a lot of sense to put characters of the Mario universe into that racing game.""
wer-ups - which are now synonymous with the series - were there, including the ability to throw shells and bananas to hamper opponents as well as collect coins to boost speed. 
It also included battle mode where players attempt to try and pop their opponent's balloons in more open environments, which remains a popular part of the series. 
rty years later, the fun of playing with friends and family remains a huge part of Mario Kart's charm. 
Following the initial game, Nintendo has gone on to release at least one new title for almost all of their subsequent consoles, along with various spin-off titles including a mobile game.
In total, nearly 168 million copies have been sold worldwide and it remains the most popular Mario spin-off game series.
""I think that as far as racing games go, in terms of sales, status or impact on the genre, it's difficult to think of a more influential one than this,"" says Toto.
game's popularity has resulted in the creation of various similar concepts by other developers such as Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing and Crash Team Racing to name a few. 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the Nintendo Switch is the latest release in the main series, and, in February 2022, a paid ""Booster Course Pass"" was announced for the game. The download pack (known in the industry as downloadable content, or DLC) will eventually bring a total of 48 more courses, in six instalments. The new racetracks will include classics from series' history, alongside various new tracks. 
With the release doubling the number of circuits available, much of the gaming community felt it was good value for money and welcomed the update. However, some were left disappointed about the lack of a new entry in the main franchise, five years after the release of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
Furthermore, when the first batch of DLC courses dropped, not all players were happy. 
Some complained that the additional circuits lacked the quality of the game's original content, while it's also been claimed that too many of the new courses are ported from the Mario Kart Tour mobile app, bringing that game's art style with them. 
Eurogamer's Oliver Mackenzie said as part of his in-depth look: ""The best MK8 tracks combine challenging sets of fast corners with extended anti-gravity sections, multiple viable routes, and track hazards.
""Most of the new tracks are sedate in comparison, with laid-back layouts, less interesting track features, and little in the way of vehicle transformations.
""Simply porting mobile tracks over without major modifications means they don't match the gameplay concepts in Mario Kart 8 especially well.""
Following the recent release of the second wave, in the conclusion of his review, Ollie Reynolds from Nintendo Life said: ""Ultimately, Wave 2 Of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe doesn't quite knock it out of the park. 
""We know we've been bashing these courses left, right, and centre, but when it comes to Mario Kart, we have pretty high standards, you know. However, none of the tracks on offer are straight-up bad; most of them just feel like 'b-side' filler when compared to the main tracks created specifically for Mario Kart 8.""
""We have to keep reminding ourselves of the bigger picture, too; we've now got 16 new courses for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and we're not even halfway through yet. We've still got a ways to go.""
With new courses releasing periodically until the end of 2023, a sequel to the bestselling game in the series so far before then is unlikely.
Nintendo declined to comment on this article.
WATCH: Mixed-reality Mario Karts race around the home
Other than Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit, an augmented reality game where a radio-controlled toy car races around the player's house while streaming video from the onboard cameras directly into the video game, there hasn't been an original release title since 2014 - with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe essentially an enhanced Nintendo Switch update of the original Mario Kart 8 title on the Wii U. 
Another highly successful game, Grand Theft Auto Five, didn't get an official sequel throughout the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One era, essentially skipping a generation and it looks as though Nintendo might do the same with the Switch and Mario Kart 8. 
However, both developers will feel as though their games have received sufficient improvements to keep them fresh. Mario Kart 8's initial upgrade to Deluxe featured various additions, including a further five playable characters and now the subsequent DLC release.
With both GTA 5 and Mario Kart 8 in the top 10 best-selling video games of all time and a GTA 5 release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X earlier this year, they continue to generate a significant amount of revenue - so perhaps it's no surprise that neither Rockstar nor Nintendo have been in a rush to release sequels.  
In terms of an eventual follow-up to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Toto predicts gamers may have to wait until the release of the Switch's successor. 
""It's hard to say but if I had to, I think there would be some distance to Mario Kart 8, maybe 2024, something like that,"" he says.
""But I think, if Mario Kart 9 comes out with a new Switch console, I think they will launch it as a launch title, or very close to launch."" 
However, any new game in such a popular series will look to bring fresh ideas to the table - something Nintendo have been able to do so far, but Toto feels one of their biggest challenges is to keep delivering moving forward.
""Mario Kart 8 is so well made, that it might even be a victim of its own success,"" he explains.
""I heard that apparently, Nintendo came up with a new idea for Mario Kart 9. I think that they need a little bit of a reboot for Mario Kart 9. I'm not saying that Nintendo is rebooting the series, but what I'm trying to say is, I think they need a new angle for the series.""
""I think that Mario Kart 9 actually has to offer something new because just a rehash of Mario Kart 8 is probably not going to cut it for Nintendo."""
technology	Attacks on politicians whipped up by abuse, MP Charlotte Nichols says	"A Labour MP who has been physically assaulted and had someone come to her office armed with a knife has said she believes much of what she has faced ""has been whipped up by things online"".
Warrington North's Charlotte Nichols said ""clear laws"" were needed to deal with ""online harassment"".
A BBC investigation found MPs received thousands of abusive tweets.
Fellow MP Angela Rayner, who has had death threats, said there was ""no excuse"" for online abuse.
uty Labour leader, who represents Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester, said she agreed with what Ms Nichols had said and it was her experience that online abuse ""comes in waves"".
BBC analysis of three million tweets aimed at MPs over a six-week period found more than 130,000, about one in 20, could be classed as toxic.
Ms Nichols received more than 11,000 messages in the period, 8.3% of which were found to be toxic, while 4% of the 83,000 tweets Ms Rayner was sent were abusive.
Other North-West MPs had similar percentages, with 4.5% of the messages sent to Ribble Valley's Conservative representative Nigel Evans being abusive, 4.3% of those sent to both Labour's Andrew Gwynne and Alison McGovern, who represent Denton and Reddish and Wirral South, and 4.8% of those sent to Angela Eagle, the Labour MP for Wallasey.
Ms Nichols told BBC North West Tonight that she believed the online abuse had led to consequences in real life. 
""I've had someone come to my office with a knife before [and] I've had physical violence against me,"" she said, adding she had stepped up security at both her home and her office.
""A lot of that has been whipped up by things that have been online.""
She said that there was a ""need to have clear laws, particularly around online harassment"", but added that politicians had to lead by example.
""I think ultimately that all of us in some form of public life, whether it's in the council chamber or the chamber in Westminster, need to be modelling a good kind of debate that is based on policies and not on personal attacks,"" she said.
Ms Nichols has previously spoken about how she has been targeted since winning her seat at the 2019 general election.
She said at the time that she was ""horrified"" by the ""extent and severity"" of anti-Semitic and homophobic abuse she had received both online and in the post.
Ms Rayner said she had received repeated abuse, including ""very derogatory language"", sexist remarks, threats against her children and being called ""stupid and thick"" because of her Manchester accent.
She said there was ""no excuse or no place"" for such comments in political debate and they caused ""significant harm"".
""These comments about my personal attributes and who I am as an individual, as opposed to policy, are the things that really worry me,"" she added.
witter has previously said it is committed to combatting abuse as outlined in its Hateful Conduct Policy.
mpany has also previously pointed out it has a much more open platform than other social media companies, which allows researchers to ""enhance and research the public conversation"".

technology	Wales TV habits see largest generational gap, Ofcom says	"Younger adults in Wales now watch about a fifth of the amount of scheduled TV than those over 55, according to a report from regulator Ofcom.
V screen time for 16 to 24-year-olds was on average one hour and six minutes.
But the older generation spent nearly half their waking day in front of the TV - at six hours.
""The streaming revolution is stretching the TV generation gap,"" said Ofcom's Director for Wales, Eleanor Marks.
She added it was ""creating a stark divide in the viewing habits of younger and older people"". 
""Traditional broadcasters face tough competition, which they've partly met through the popularity of their own on-demand player apps. 
""Combined viewing to the main five Public Service Broadcasting (PBS) channels continues to account for more than half of broadcast TV viewing in Wales.""
report also found TV users in Wales were more likely than the UK average to have a connected TV.
Covid-19 restrictions in Wales were thought to be the main drivers for the increase in screen time in 2020 - when people spent five hours and six minutes on average watching TV and video content per day. 
figure fell by 33 minutes in 2021. 
Growth was also seen in video-on-demand services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+.
Ofcom said about a fifth homes in the UK subscribed to all three of the most popular platforms. 
And in Wales, they proved increasingly popular with 70% of households signing up to at least one - up from 64% in 2021.
report noted nine in 10 people aged 18 to 24 bypassed TV channels and headed straight to streaming, on-demand and social video services when looking for something to watch.
Meanwhile 59% of 55 to 64-year-olds still enjoyed a flick through the channels first.
In 2021, nine in 10 adults listened to the radio in Wales for an average of 22 hours each week, with BBC network radio stations continuing to have the largest market share.
Wales also appeared to be leading the way in old-fashioned listening habits. 
Listening to live radio on a radio set was higher for adults in Wales, at 74%, compared with 65% of adults in Great Britain.
But weekly reach of music streaming and online radio was lower than average.

technology	YouTube joins Facebook in banning Andrew Tate	"YouTube has banned influencer Andrew Tate for violating its policies.
Google-owned social media site took action following Meta's decision to ban Mr Tate from Facebook and Instagram.
former kickboxer rose to fame in 2016 when he was removed from TV show Big Brother over a video which appeared to depict him attacking a woman.
He went on to gain notoriety online - with Twitter banning him for saying women should ""bear responsibility"" for being sexually assaulted.
At the time of his removal from Big Brother, in 2016, Mr Tate said the controversial video had been edited, calling it ""a total lie trying to make me look bad"". 
Google, which owns YouTube, told the BBC: ""We terminated channels associated with Andrew Tate for multiple violations of our Community Guidelines and Terms of Service, including our hate speech policy. 
""If a channel is terminated, the uploader is unable to use, own or create any other YouTube channels.""
Mr Tate's YouTube channels had more than a million followers between them.
kTok has also banned an account belonging to Mr Tate as part of an ongoing investigation to remove content that violates its policies.
A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC: ""Misogyny is a hateful ideology that is not tolerated on TikTok.
""We've been removing violative videos and accounts for weeks, and we welcome the news that other platforms are also taking action against this individual.""
On Instagram, Tate had 4.7 million followers at the time his account was removed. That number had grown rapidly from around one million followers in June.
Meta said it had removed the kickboxing star from its platforms for violating its policies on dangerous organisations and individuals, but did not provide further details.
BBC has approached Mr Tate for comment.
By Marianna Spring, disinformation and social media correspondent
Andrew Tate's videos - promoting misogyny and targeting women - have come to prominence this summer, with many teens commenting on just how much he's appearing on their social media feeds. 
His content has raised concerns about the real-world effect it could have, especially on the younger users exposed to it during their school holidays when they have time on their hands.
focus has been primarily on TikTok, where users say they've been readily served up his videos - sparking a new wave of videos commenting on and criticising Mr Tate's content. 
YouTube has also found itself under pressure, since it's where he has racked up millions of views.
I revealed how social media sites promote anti-women hate for BBC Panorama. The investigations exposed how some platforms' algorithms were recommending more and more misogyny to a troll account. 
Since then, several sites have made commitments to better protect female users. But, once again, questions are being raised about the role social media sites play in pushing anti-women content. 
Mr Tate has drawn criticism online for his comments, particularly from UK advocacy group Hope Not Hate, which welcomed Meta's ban last week.
Joe Mulhall, director of research at the group, said Mr Tate ""poses a genuine threat to young men, radicalising them towards extremism misogyny, racism and homophobia"".
He added: ""We've provided significant evidence to the major social media platforms, including Meta, about his activity and why he must be removed.""
Videos about Mr Tate have proved popular across social media platforms, particularly on TikTok where videos using the #AndrewTate hashtag have been viewed more than 12.7 billion times.
But this number represents not just videos of Tate and his supporters - it also includes videos made by people criticising the influencer.
On YouTube, some of his most popular videos have had millions of views.
In one video, during which he was interviewed by another YouTuber, he said he was ""absolutely a misogynist"", adding: ""I'm a realist and when you're a realist you're sexist. There's no way you can be rooted in reality and not be sexist.""
Later in the same video he called women ""intrinsically lazy"" and said there was ""no such thing as an independent female"".
In a different video, Mr Tate said: ""If I have responsibility over her, then I must have a degree of authority.""
He added: ""You can't be responsible for a dog if it doesn't obey you."""
technology	AI tools fail to reduce recruitment bias - study	"Artificially intelligent hiring tools do not reduce bias or improve diversity, researchers say in a study.
""There is growing interest in new ways of solving problems such as interview bias,"" the Cambridge University researchers say, in the journal Philosophy and Technology
use of AI is becoming widespread - but its analysis of candidate videos or applications is ""pseudoscience"". 
A professional body for human resources told BBC News AI could counter bias.
In 2020, the study notes, an international survey of 500 human-resources professionals suggested nearly a quarter were using AI for ""talent acquisition, in the form of automation"".
But using it to reduce bias is counter-productive and, University of Cambridge's Centre for Gender Studies post-doctoral researcher Dr Kerry Mackereth told BBC News, based on ""a myth"".
""These tools can't be trained to only identify job-related characteristics and strip out gender and race from the hiring process, because the kinds of attributes we think are essential for being a good employee are inherently bound up with gender and race,"" she said.
Some companies have also found these tools problematic, the study notes.
In 2018, for example, Amazon announced it had scrapped the development of an AI-powered recruitment engine because it could detect gender from CVs and discriminated against female applicants.
Of particular concern to the researchers were tools to ""analyse the minutiae of a candidate's speech and bodily movements"" to see how closely they resembled a company's supposed ideal employee.
Video and image analysis technology had ""no scientific basis"", co-author Dr Eleanor Drage told BBC News, dismissing it as ""modern phrenology"", the false theory skull shape could reveal character and mental faculties.
""They say that they can know your personality from looking at your face. The idea is that, like a lie-detector test, AI can see 'through' your face to the real you,"" she told BBC News.
With six computer-science students, the researchers built their own simplified AI recruitment tool, to rate candidates' photographs for the ""big five"" personality traits: 
But the ratings were skewed by many irrelevant variables.
""When you use our tool, you can see that your personality score changes when you alter the contrast/brightness/saturation,"" Dr Drage wrote.
gy news site The Register noted other investigations had reached a similar conclusion. 
A German public broadcaster found wearing glasses or a headscarf in a video changed a candidate's scores.
Hayfa Mohdzaini, from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, told BBC News its research suggested only 8% of employers used AI to select candidates.
""AI can efficiently help increase an organisation's diversity by filtering from a larger candidate pool - but it can also miss out on lots of good candidates if the rules and training data are incomplete or inaccurate,"" she said.
""AI software to analyse candidates' voice and body language in recruitment is in its infancy and therefore carries both opportunities and risks."" "
